It integrates deeply with Nx workspaces. Recently, we've also added features to [enhance your LLM assistant](/features/enhance-AI) with rich context about your monorepo, which is particularly valuable for exploring large codebases. Our Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration specifically improves the AI's reasoning capabilities in these complex environments. Read more in the [announcement blog post](/blog/nx-made-cursor-smarter).\n    12\t\n    13\tWhile often associated with code generation, LLMs are **incredibly powerful for exploration and understanding complex codebases**. Imagine onboarding a new developer onto a large project – an LLM armed with workspace context could significantly speed up their learning process.\n    14\t\n    15\tI recently experienced this firsthand as I needed to test an upcoming PR for Nx Console itself. Having not touched the packaging part of the codebase for a while, I wasn't sure about the current structure or how to generate the `.vsix` package for local testing. Instead of manually digging through files, I decided to leverage Nx Console's own LLM integration within the Nx Console codebase (pure inception!). I used it to query the structure and figure out the necessary build commands.\n    16\t\n    17\tLet's see how that went.\n    18\t\n    19\t{% toc /%}\n    20\t\n    21\t## Setting up the Nx MCP\n    22\t\n    23\tFirst, you need to ensure the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration is set up, which allows Cursor to understand your Nx workspace. This starts with having the [Nx Console](/getting-started/editor-setup) extension installed, as it provides the necessary MCP server.\n    24\t\n    25\tWhen you start Cursor (version 0.46 or newer) in an Nx workspace with Nx Console present, it should automatically detect the server and prompt you via a notification to enable the \"Nx Enhancement\" agent. Clicking the notification is the easiest way, but you can also manually trigger the setup using the `nx.configureMcpServer` command from the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`).\n    26\t\n    27\tFinally, verify that the \"Nx Console MCP\" server is listed and enabled within Cursor's settings (`Cursor -> Settings -> Cursor Settings -> MCP`). This step confirms that Cursor is connected to the local MCP server provided by Nx Console. Once enabled, the AI assistant gains access to a powerful set of tools, allowing it to query detailed information about your Nx workspace structure, project configurations, and task dependencies.\n    28\t\n    29\t![Making sure the Nx MCP is registered in Cursor settings](/blog/images/articles/cursor-mcp-registered.avif)\n    30\t\n    31\tThe [docs have all the details](/features/enhance-AI) if you need more infos.\n    32\t\n    33\t## Figuring out the Build Process\n    34\t\n    35\tMy goal was to build the VS Code extension package (`.vsix` file) so I could install and test it locally.

This explicitly tells Nx to run the `build` target before executing the `package` command.\n    85\t\n    86\tThis **understanding comes directly from the structured data provided by the MCP server about the Nx workspace's configuration and task graph**. Without the MCP, the AI would lack the context of Nx's task dependency system.\n    87\t\n    88\t## Wrapping Up\n    89\t\n    90\tMuch of the buzz around LLMs focuses on code generation (a major use case, for sure) or even the more extreme \"vibe coding\". However, as this walkthrough demonstrates, using LLMs for **exploring and understanding large codebases** is an incredibly valuable application, especially within an Nx monorepo enhanced with our MCP integration.\n    91\t\n    92\tThink about navigating an unfamiliar project: you can ask the AI where specific functionality is located, how different parts are connected, or where new code should ideally be placed.

Without the MCP, the AI would lack the context of Nx's task dependency system.\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nMuch of the buzz around LLMs focuses on code generation (a major use case, for sure) or even the more extreme \"vibe coding\". However, as this walkthrough demonstrates, using LLMs for **exploring and understanding large codebases** is an incredibly valuable application, especially within an Nx monorepo enhanced with our MCP integration.\n\nThink about navigating an unfamiliar project: you can ask the AI where specific functionality is located, how different parts are connected, or where new code should ideally be placed. This can help accelerate the onboarding process for new team members.\n\nWe're really just getting started with Nx's LLM integration.

However, without proper context, **LLMs struggle to understand your workspace architecture**, seeing only individual files rather than the complete picture.\n\nNx's transforms your AI assistant by providing rich workspace metadata that enables it to:\n\n- Understand your **workspace architecture** and project relationships\n- Identify **project owners** and team responsibilities\n- Access **Nx documentation** for accurate guidance\n- Leverage **code generators** for consistent scaffolding\n- Connect to your **CI pipeline** to help fix failures\n\nThe goal is to transform your AI assistant from a generic code helper into an architecturally-aware collaborator that understands your specific workspace structure and can make intelligent, context-aware decisions.\n\n## How Nx MCP Enhances Your LLM\n\nThe [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard that enables AI models to interact with your development environment through a standardized interface. Nx implements an MCP server via the [Nx Console](/getting-started/editor-setup) that exposes workspace metadata to compatible AI assistants like GitHub Copilot, Claude, and others.\n\nWith the Nx MCP server, your AI assistant gains a \"map\" of your entire system being able to go from just reasoning at the file level to seeing the more high level picture. This allows the LLM to move between different abstraction levels - from high-level architecture down to specific implementation details:\n\n![Different abstraction levels](/blog/images/articles/nx-ai-abstraction-levels.avif)\n\nThese are some of the available tools which the Nx MCP server exposes:\n\n- **`nx_workspace`**: Provides a comprehensive view of your Nx configuration and project graph\n- **`nx_project_details`**: Returns detailed configuration for specific projects\n- **`nx_docs`**: Retrieves relevant documentation based on queries\n- **`nx_generators`**: Lists available code generators in your workspace\n- **`nx_generator_schema`**: Provides detailed schema information for generators\n- **`nx_visualize_graph`**: Opens interactive project or task graph visualizations\n- **`nx_cloud_cipe_details`**: Returns information about CI pipelines from Nx Cloud\n- **`nx_cloud_fix_cipe_failure`**: Provides detailed information about CI failures to help fix issues\n\n## Setting Up Nx MCP\n\nThe Nx MCP server is part of Nx Console and can be easily configured in supported editors:\n\n### VS Code / Cursor Setup\n\n1. Install [Nx Console](/getting-started/editor-setup) from the marketplace\n2. You'll receive a notification to \"Improve Copilot/AI agent with Nx-specific context\"\n3.

In our [previous posts](/blog/nx-just-made-your-llm-smarter), we've shown how Nx makes your LLM smarter by providing rich metadata about your monorepo structure. We've also discussed our [MCP server implementations](/blog/nx-made-cursor-smarter) for both [Cursor](/blog/nx-made-cursor-smarter) and [VS Code Copilot](/blog/nx-mcp-vscode-copilot).\n    22\t\n    23\tToday, we're taking this integration to the next level by connecting your CI pipeline directly to your AI assistant, creating a fully integrated workflow that helps you **detect and fix** failing builds faster than ever before.\n    24\t\n    25\t{% toc /%}\n    26\t\n    27\t## The Full Circle: From Editor to CI and Back\n    28\t\n    29\tWhen you work in a large codebase, you often follow this workflow:\n    30\t\n    31\t1. You make changes to your code in your editor\n    32\t2. You commit and push those changes to GitHub\n    33\t3. A CI run is triggered to validate your changes\n    34\t4. You continue working on something else while CI runs\n    35\t5. Eventually, you check back to see if your CI passed\n    36\t6. If it failed, you have to understand why and fix it\n    37\t7. Push again and wait for another CI run\n    38\t\n    39\tThis process introduces significant delays in your workflow. The **biggest waste of time happens between steps 4 and 5**. While your CI is running, you've already context-switched to another task. Your CI might fail after just a few minutes, but you won't know until you manually check back - which could be 30 minutes, an hour, or even after lunch. All that time is wasted when you could have fixed the issue immediately and triggered a new CI run.\n    40\t\n    41\t**What if your editor could notify you as soon as a CI failure happens and help you fix it immediately?**\n    42\t\n    43\tThat's exactly what our new integration does. By connecting [Nx Console](/getting-started/editor-setup), [Nx Cloud](/nx-cloud), and our [MCP server](/features/enhance-AI), we've created a workflow that:\n    44\t\n    45\t1. Notifies you in your editor when your CI build fails\n    46\t2. Provides a one-click option to have an AI assistant help you fix the issue\n    47\t3. Automatically applies the fix to your local workspace\n    48\t4. Lets you review and push the changes to update your PR\n    49\t\n    50\t## How It Works\n    51\t\n    52\t![Integration between Nx Console, Nx Cloud and the Nx MCP](/blog/images/articles/nx-mcp-ci-architecture.avif)\n    53\t\n    54\tThis integration leverages multiple components of the Nx ecosystem:\n    55\t\n    56\t- **Nx Console Extension**: Our editor extension (available for [VS Code, Cursor, and IntelliJ](/getting-started/editor-setup)) monitors your CI runs through Nx Cloud. We [wrote about this previously](/blog/nx-cloud-pipelines-come-to-nx-console).\n    57\t\n    58\t- **Nx Cloud**: Our CI acceleration service not only makes your builds faster but also maintains detailed information about each task, including failures, logs, and affected projects.\n    59\t\n    60\t- **MCP Server**: The Model Context Protocol server we've implemented provides a structured interface for AI assistants to interact with your codebase and Nx tools.\n    61\t\n    62\t- **AI Assistant**: Whether you're using GitHub Copilot, Claude, or another AI assistant that supports MCP, it can leverage all this context to understand and fix CI errors.\n    63\t\n    64\tWhen a CI build fails, the Nx Console extension receives a notification from Nx Cloud. It then displays an alert in your editor with options to view the logs or have AI help fix the issue.\n    65\t\n    66\t![Nx Console shows the notification of the CI failure](/blog/images/articles/ci-notification.avif)\n    67\t\n    68\tIf you choose AI assistance, the MCP server:\n    69\t\n    70\t1. Retrieves detailed information about the failed CI run from Nx Cloud\n    71\t2. Provides this context to your AI assistant\n    72\t3. Allows the assistant to analyze your git history to understand what changed in your PR\n    73\t4.

In our [previous posts](/blog/nx-just-made-your-llm-smarter), we've shown how Nx makes your LLM smarter by providing rich metadata about your monorepo structure. We've also discussed our [MCP server implementations](/blog/nx-made-cursor-smarter) for both [Cursor](/blog/nx-made-cursor-smarter) and [VS Code Copilot](/blog/nx-mcp-vscode-copilot).\n\nToday, we're taking this integration to the next level by connecting your CI pipeline directly to your AI assistant, creating a fully integrated workflow that helps you **detect and fix** failing builds faster than ever before.\n\n{% toc /%}\n\n## The Full Circle: From Editor to CI and Back\n\nWhen you work in a large codebase, you often follow this workflow:\n\n1. You make changes to your code in your editor\n2. You commit and push those changes to GitHub\n3. A CI run is triggered to validate your changes\n4. You continue working on something else while CI runs\n5. Eventually, you check back to see if your CI passed\n6. If it failed, you have to understand why and fix it\n7. Push again and wait for another CI run\n\nThis process introduces significant delays in your workflow. The **biggest waste of time happens between steps 4 and 5**. While your CI is running, you've already context-switched to another task. Your CI might fail after just a few minutes, but you won't know until you manually check back - which could be 30 minutes, an hour, or even after lunch. All that time is wasted when you could have fixed the issue immediately and triggered a new CI run.\n\n**What if your editor could notify you as soon as a CI failure happens and help you fix it immediately?**\n\nThat's exactly what our new integration does. By connecting [Nx Console](/getting-started/editor-setup), [Nx Cloud](/nx-cloud), and our [MCP server](/features/enhance-AI), we've created a workflow that:\n\n1. Notifies you in your editor when your CI build fails\n2. Provides a one-click option to have an AI assistant help you fix the issue\n3. Automatically applies the fix to your local workspace\n4. Lets you review and push the changes to update your PR\n\n## How It Works\n\n![Integration between Nx Console, Nx Cloud and the Nx MCP](/blog/images/articles/nx-mcp-ci-architecture.avif)\n\nThis integration leverages multiple components of the Nx ecosystem:\n\n- **Nx Console Extension**: Our editor extension (available for [VS Code, Cursor, and IntelliJ](/getting-started/editor-setup)) monitors your CI runs through Nx Cloud. We [wrote about this previously](/blog/nx-cloud-pipelines-come-to-nx-console).\n\n- **Nx Cloud**: Our CI acceleration service not only makes your builds faster but also maintains detailed information about each task, including failures, logs, and affected projects.\n\n- **MCP Server**: The Model Context Protocol server we've implemented provides a structured interface for AI assistants to interact with your codebase and Nx tools.\n\n- **AI Assistant**: Whether you're using GitHub Copilot, Claude, or another AI assistant that supports MCP, it can leverage all this context to understand and fix CI errors.\n\nWhen a CI build fails, the Nx Console extension receives a notification from Nx Cloud. It then displays an alert in your editor with options to view the logs or have AI help fix the issue.\n\n![Nx Console shows the notification of the CI failure](/blog/images/articles/ci-notification.avif)\n\nIf you choose AI assistance, the MCP server:\n\n1. Retrieves detailed information about the failed CI run from Nx Cloud\n2. Provides this context to your AI assistant\n3. Allows the assistant to analyze your git history to understand what changed in your PR\n4. Helps the assistant navigate your codebase to identify and fix the issue\n\n## The Power of AI + Context: Why This Integration Works\n\nThe key advantage of this integration is the rich contextual data provided to the AI assistant:\n\n- **MCP Server with Local Nx Data**: Nx deeply understands your workspace structure - how projects relate to each other, which tasks run where, and your project's dependencies. Our MCP server exposes this knowledge to the LLM, providing the context it needs to navigate your codebase intelligently.\n\n- **Nx Cloud CI Information**: The MCP server also receives detailed CI failure data from Nx Cloud - exact error logs, which tasks failed, and under what conditions.

transforming basic code helpers into architecturally-aware development partners.\"\n\n**Primary CTA:** \"Enhance Your AI Assistant\"\n**Secondary CTA:** \"Watch 3-min Demo\"\n\n### Problem Statement Section\n\n**Headline:** \"Why Your AI Assistant Struggles with Enterprise Codebases\"\n\n**Four Core Problems:**\n\n1. **Limited Context** - LLMs only see individual files, missing architectural relationships. As monorepos grow larger, this problem compounds dramatically, requiring developers to manually provide context for every interaction.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Output** - AI generates code that doesn't follow your team's best practices and may introduce breaking changes by deprecating components it doesn't see being used elsewhere in the codebase.\n\n3. **No Workspace Awareness** - Can't understand project dependencies, ownership, or integration points, making it difficult for AI to know where to start when fixing issues across multiple projects.\n\n4. **Manual Context Burden** - Developers must constantly provide the same contextual information about project structure, relationships, and interdependencies, negating much of the productivity gains AI promises.\n\n**Visual:** Diagram showing LLM with limited \"street view\" vs. Nx providing \"map view\" of codebase, with callouts showing the increasing context burden as repository size grows.\n\n**Additional Callout Box:**\n\"As monorepos scale, AI tools become progressively less effective - a challenge that only architectural intelligence can solve. While type safety provides some guardrails, it's not enough without true workspace understanding.\"\n\n### Solution Overview Section\n\n**Headline:** \"Nx Provides the Missing Context Your AI Needs\"\n\n**Core Value Props:**\n\n1. **Architectural Awareness** - Move from file-level to workspace-level understanding\n2. **Predictable + Intelligent** - Combine consistent generators with AI customization\n3. **Integrated Workflows** - Connect editor, CI, and AI for seamless development\n\n### Features Deep Dive\n\n#### 1.

It integrates deeply with Nx workspaces. Recently, we've also added features to [enhance your LLM assistant](/features/enhance-AI) with rich context about your monorepo, which is particularly valuable for exploring large codebases. Our Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration specifically improves the AI's reasoning capabilities in these complex environments. Read more in the [announcement blog post](/blog/nx-made-cursor-smarter).\n    12\t\n    13\tWhile often associated with code generation, LLMs are **incredibly powerful for exploration and understanding complex codebases**. Imagine onboarding a new developer onto a large project – an LLM armed with workspace context could significantly speed up their learning process.\n    14\t\n    15\tI recently experienced this firsthand as I needed to test an upcoming PR for Nx Console itself. Having not touched the packaging part of the codebase for a while, I wasn't sure about the current structure or how to generate the `.vsix` package for local testing. Instead of manually digging through files, I decided to leverage Nx Console's own LLM integration within the Nx Console codebase (pure inception!). I used it to query the structure and figure out the necessary build commands.\n    16\t\n    17\tLet's see how that went.\n    18\t\n    19\t{% toc /%}\n    20\t\n    21\t## Setting up the Nx MCP\n    22\t\n    23\tFirst, you need to ensure the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration is set up, which allows Cursor to understand your Nx workspace. This starts with having the [Nx Console](/getting-started/editor-setup) extension installed, as it provides the necessary MCP server.\n    24\t\n    25\tWhen you start Cursor (version 0.46 or newer) in an Nx workspace with Nx Console present, it should automatically detect the server and prompt you via a notification to enable the \"Nx Enhancement\" agent. Clicking the notification is the easiest way, but you can also manually trigger the setup using the `nx.configureMcpServer` command from the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`).\n    26\t\n    27\tFinally, verify that the \"Nx Console MCP\" server is listed and enabled within Cursor's settings (`Cursor -> Settings -> Cursor Settings -> MCP`). This step confirms that Cursor is connected to the local MCP server provided by Nx Console. Once enabled, the AI assistant gains access to a powerful set of tools, allowing it to query detailed information about your Nx workspace structure, project configurations, and task dependencies.\n    28\t\n    29\t![Making sure the Nx MCP is registered in Cursor settings](/blog/images/articles/cursor-mcp-registered.avif)\n    30\t\n    31\tThe [docs have all the details](/features/enhance-AI) if you need more infos.\n    32\t\n    33\t## Figuring out the Build Process\n    34\t\n    35\tMy goal was to build the VS Code extension package (`.vsix` file) so I could install and test it locally.

It integrates deeply with Nx workspaces. Recently, we've also added features to [enhance your LLM assistant](/features/enhance-AI) with rich context about your monorepo, which is particularly valuable for exploring large codebases. Our Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration specifically improves the AI's reasoning capabilities in these complex environments. Read more in the [announcement blog post](/blog/nx-made-cursor-smarter).\n\nWhile often associated with code generation, LLMs are **incredibly powerful for exploration and understanding complex codebases**. Imagine onboarding a new developer onto a large project – an LLM armed with workspace context could significantly speed up their learning process.\n\nI recently experienced this firsthand as I needed to test an upcoming PR for Nx Console itself. Having not touched the packaging part of the codebase for a while, I wasn't sure about the current structure or how to generate the `.vsix` package for local testing. Instead of manually digging through files, I decided to leverage Nx Console's own LLM integration within the Nx Console codebase (pure inception!). I used it to query the structure and figure out the necessary build commands.\n\nLet's see how that went.\n\n{% toc /%}\n\n## Setting up the Nx MCP\n\nFirst, you need to ensure the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration is set up, which allows Cursor to understand your Nx workspace. This starts with having the [Nx Console](/getting-started/editor-setup) extension installed, as it provides the necessary MCP server.\n\nWhen you start Cursor (version 0.46 or newer) in an Nx workspace with Nx Console present, it should automatically detect the server and prompt you via a notification to enable the \"Nx Enhancement\" agent. Clicking the notification is the easiest way, but you can also manually trigger the setup using the `nx.configureMcpServer` command from the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`).\n\nFinally, verify that the \"Nx Console MCP\" server is listed and enabled within Cursor's settings (`Cursor -> Settings -> Cursor Settings -> MCP`). This step confirms that Cursor is connected to the local MCP server provided by Nx Console. Once enabled, the AI assistant gains access to a powerful set of tools, allowing it to query detailed information about your Nx workspace structure, project configurations, and task dependencies.\n\n![Making sure the Nx MCP is registered in Cursor settings](/blog/images/articles/cursor-mcp-registered.avif)\n\nThe [docs have all the details](/features/enhance-AI) if you need more infos.\n\n## Figuring out the Build Process\n\nMy goal was to build the VS Code extension package (`.vsix` file) so I could install and test it locally. I wasn't sure about the exact command.\n\n**Query:** \"What command can I use to build the VS Code extension so I can try it out locally?\"\n\nInitially, the assistant might search for generic build scripts. However, thanks to the `nx_workspace` tool provided by the MCP, it quickly identifies the project as an Nx workspace.\n\n![MCP identifying Nx workspace and project structure](/blog/images/articles/mcp-identifying-nx-workspace.avif)\n\nIt accesses the workspace details and finds the `project.json` for the VS Code extension project (likely located under an `apps` directory). Within this file, it discovers the available targets, including `build` and `package`.\n\n**Query:** \"What is the difference between the `build` and `package` command? I want to get an extension VSIX file that I can install. Which one should I use?\"\n\nThe assistant, using the `nx_project_details` tool, examines the configuration for both targets. It determines that the `package` target is the one that produces the `.vsix` file needed for installation, while `build` likely just compiles the code.\n\n## Understanding Task Dependencies\n\nA common question when dealing with [build pipelines](/features/run-tasks#defining-a-task-pipeline) is whether prerequisite steps need to be run manually.\n\n**Query:** \"When I run the package command, do I need to run build beforehand?\"\n\nThis is where the Nx MCP integration truly shines. Nx allows defining dependencies between tasks. The assistant analyzes the project configuration again.\n\n**Query:** \"Where is that dependency between the `package` and `build` command defined?\"\n\nIt reads the `project.json` for the VS Code project, specifically looking at the `package` target:\n\n```json\n// Example structure within project.json (apps/vscode/project.json)\n{\n  // ... other config ...\n  \"targets\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      // build configuration\n    },\n    \"package\": {\n      \"executor\": \"nx:run-commands\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"commands\": [\"node ./tools/scripts/vscode-vsce.js\"]\n      },\n      \"dependsOn\": [\n        \"build\" // <-- Here's the dependency!\n        \"^build\"\n      ]\n    }\n    // ... other targets ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe assistant points out the `dependsOn` array within the `package` target configuration. This explicitly tells Nx to run the `build` target before executing the `package` command.\n\nThis **understanding comes directly from the structured data provided by the MCP server about the Nx workspace's configuration and task graph**. Without the MCP, the AI would lack the context of Nx's task dependency system.\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nMuch of the buzz around LLMs focuses on code generation (a major use case, for sure) or even the more extreme \"vibe coding\".

Most importantly, this enables Copilot to move beyond simple file-level understanding to gain more of an **architectural awareness of your workspace**. Instead of just seeing individual files and their contents, it now understands the broader context: how projects are connected, where integration points exist, which teams own what, and how changes might impact the broader system. This architectural awareness is particularly powerful in a monorepo setting, where understanding these relationships is crucial for making informed development decisions.\n    55\t\n    56\t## Nx MCP in Action\n    57\t\n    58\tLet's look at some practical examples of how Nx MCP enhances your AI assistant's capabilities:\n    59\t\n    60\t### Understanding Project Relationships\n    61\t\n    62\tYou can ask questions about project dependencies and get accurate answers based on the actual project graph:\n    63\t\n    64\t```typescript\n    65\t// Example query:\n    66\t'Use the provided Nx MCP tools to figure out which order projects\n    67\tare related to the data-access-order project';\n    68\t```\n    69\t\n    70\tThe AI will use the `nx_workspace` tool to analyze project relationships and can even visualize them using the `nx_visualize_graph` tool, showing both direct dependencies and upstream projects.\n    71\t\n    72\t### Smart Code Generation\n    73\t\n    74\tWhile LLMs can generate code on their own, Nx MCP provides a powerful combination of predictable code generation through Nx generators and AI-driven customization:\n    75\t\n    76\t```typescript\n    77\t// Example query:\n    78\t\"Create a new feature library in packages/order/feat-cancel-order.\n    79\tMake it a React library and link it to the data-access-order project.\n    80\tDon't use a bundler or generate components.\"\n    81\t```\n    82\t\n    83\tThe AI will:\n    84\t\n    85\t1. Use `nx_generators` to identify available generators\n    86\t2. Execute the React library generator with precise options\n    87\t3. Set up proper project tags and dependencies\n    88\t\n    89\t### Documentation-Aware Configuration\n    90\t\n    91\tTo prevent hallucination and ensure up-to-date information, Nx MCP provides access to the current Nx documentation:\n    92\t\n    93\t```typescript\n    94\t// Example query:\n    95\t'Add a task pipeline in nx.json that runs the build of all downstream projects before the dev command';\n    96\t```\n    97\t\n    98\tThe AI will:\n    99\t\n   100\t1. Query the Nx docs for task pipeline configuration\n   101\t2. Update `nx.json` with the correct syntax\n   102\t3. Configure the dependencies accurately\n   103\t\n   104\t## Beyond File-Level Thinking\n   105\t\n   106\tThis integration isn't just about fancy AI features - it's about making your existing editor experience more productive by integrating AI capabilities where they actually make sense. Instead of jumping on the AI hype train, we're focusing on exposing Nx's deep understanding of your workspace directly in your editor through tools like Copilot. This enables:\n   107\t\n   108\t- More precise and contextual suggestions\n   109\t- Architecture-aware refactoring\n   110\t- Better understanding of project boundaries and relationships\n   111\t- Improved onboarding assistance for new team members\n   112\t\n   113\tWe're actively developing this integration and would love to hear your feedback!

This architectural awareness is particularly powerful in a monorepo setting, where understanding these relationships is crucial for making informed development decisions.\n\n## Nx MCP in Action\n\nLet's look at some practical examples of how Nx MCP enhances your AI assistant's capabilities:\n\n### Understanding Project Relationships\n\nYou can ask questions about project dependencies and get accurate answers based on the actual project graph:\n\n```typescript\n// Example query:\n'Use the provided Nx MCP tools to figure out which order projects\nare related to the data-access-order project';\n```\n\nThe AI will use the `nx_workspace` tool to analyze project relationships and can even visualize them using the `nx_visualize_graph` tool, showing both direct dependencies and upstream projects.\n\n### Smart Code Generation\n\nWhile LLMs can generate code on their own, Nx MCP provides a powerful combination of predictable code generation through Nx generators and AI-driven customization:\n\n```typescript\n// Example query:\n\"Create a new feature library in packages/order/feat-cancel-order.\nMake it a React library and link it to the data-access-order project.\nDon't use a bundler or generate components.\"\n```\n\nThe AI will:\n\n1. Use `nx_generators` to identify available generators\n2. Execute the React library generator with precise options\n3. Set up proper project tags and dependencies\n\n### Documentation-Aware Configuration\n\nTo prevent hallucination and ensure up-to-date information, Nx MCP provides access to the current Nx documentation:\n\n```typescript\n// Example query:\n'Add a task pipeline in nx.json that runs the build of all downstream projects before the dev command';\n```\n\nThe AI will:\n\n1. Query the Nx docs for task pipeline configuration\n2. Update `nx.json` with the correct syntax\n3. Configure the dependencies accurately\n\n## Beyond File-Level Thinking\n\nThis integration isn't just about fancy AI features - it's about making your existing editor experience more productive by integrating AI capabilities where they actually make sense. Instead of jumping on the AI hype train, we're focusing on exposing Nx's deep understanding of your workspace directly in your editor through tools like Copilot. This enables:\n\n- More precise and contextual suggestions\n- Architecture-aware refactoring\n- Better understanding of project boundaries and relationships\n- Improved onboarding assistance for new team members\n\nWe're actively developing this integration and would love to hear your feedback!

It provides a standardized interface for tools and resources that can be used by AI assistants to better understand and interact with your codebase.\n    30\t\n    31\t![mcp-architecture.avif](/blog/images/articles/mcp-architecture.avif)\n    32\t\n    33\t_(Source: [Official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io))_\n    34\t\n    35\tAccording to the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction), it's designed to:\n    36\t\n    37\t- Provide structured access to development tools and resources\n    38\t- Enable AI models to take actions in your development environment\n    39\t- Create a consistent interface for different AI assistants\n    40\t- Allow for better context management and tool selection\n    41\t\n    42\tThis protocol is particularly powerful for monorepo development because it allows AI assistants to understand not just individual files, but the entire workspace structure, project relationships, and available tools. When combined with Nx's rich metadata about your monorepo, it creates an incredibly powerful development experience.\n    43\t\n    44\tThe advantage of MCP is that it can become a standard. In fact, more and more libraries provide implementations (e.g. [Spring AI's MCP integration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/mcp/mcp-overview.html)).\n    45\t\n    46\tWe're leveraging this by exposing such an MCP from our Nx Language server that comes with Nx Console so Cursor and other MCP compatible clients can automatically hook into the data Nx has about your workspace.\n    47\t\n    48\t## How to enable it in your Cursor IDE\n    49\t\n    50\tGetting started with Nx's MCP integration in Cursor is straightforward. Here's what you need to do:\n    51\t\n    52\t**Install Nx Console** in your Cursor IDE by following our [editor setup guide](/getting-started/editor-setup).\n    53\t\n    54\tOnce installed, Cursor will automatically detect Nx Console and prompt you to configure the MCP server. You'll see a notification like this:\n    55\t\n    56\t![cursor-nx-notification.avif](/blog/images/articles/cursor-nx-notification.avif)\n    57\t\n    58\t**Click on the notification** to open Cursor's settings.

When you enable the integration, we automatically spin up a local MCP server that communicates with Cursor using Server-Sent Events (SSE). This server runs on a random available port on your localhost, ensuring it doesn't conflict with other services.\n    85\t\n    86\t![Cursor MCP Architecture Diagram](/blog/images/articles/mcp-nx-architecture.avif)\n    87\t\n    88\tThe MCP server is configured through the `.cursor/mcp.json` file, which is automatically created in your workspace as mentioned in the previous section. Nx Console will automatically read the port specified there and spin up a matching MCP server.\n    89\tYou can always view and modify the configuration through `Cursor Settings -> MCP`.\n    90\t\n    91\t### Available Tools\n    92\t\n    93\tWhile the Model Context Protocol defines various functionalities (tools, resources, roots, and sampling), support in popular clients like Cursor or Claude Desktop is limited. For now, we've focused on providing a set of essential tools that leverage Nx's rich metadata:\n    94\t\n    95\t- `nx_workspace`: Provides an annotated representation of your Nx configuration and project graph\n    96\t- `nx_project_details`: Returns comprehensive configuration for any specific Nx project\n    97\t- `nx_docs`: Retrieves relevant documentation sections based on your queries\n    98\t- `nx_generators`: Lists all available code generators in your workspace\n    99\t- `nx_generator_schema`: Provides detailed schema information for specific generators\n   100\t- `nx_visualize_graph`: Opens interactive project or task graph visualizations directly in your IDE\n   101\t\n   102\t### Data Flow\n   103\t\n   104\tBehind the scenes, we use the Nx Language Server (`nxls`) that comes as part of the [Nx Console extension](/getting-started/editor-setup) to gather workspace information. Each tool request triggers a specific data flow:\n   105\t\n   106\t1. The tool receives your query\n   107\t2. `nxls` retrieves relevant workspace information from your Nx workspace\n   108\t3. We transform this data into a format optimized for LLM consumption\n   109\t4. The transformed data is enriched with natural language descriptions\n   110\t5. The result is passed back to the AI assistant\n   111\t\n   112\tFor example, when handling project graph queries, we transform the raw graph data into a more structured format that includes explanations about project relationships and dependencies. You can see this transformation in action in our [project graph transformation code](https://github.com/nrwl/nx-console/blob/9a0425d8c0ae74d326bdd030e8793f2c4d0161e9/libs/shared/llm-context/src/lib/project-graph.ts#L5).\n   113\t\n   114\t### IDE Integration\n   115\t\n   116\tThe MCP's true potential lies in its deep integration with your IDE. Right now, it can trigger these actions directly in your IDE:\n   117\t\n   118\t- Visualize the project graph focused on a specific project\n   119\t- Visualize the task graph for a specific project and target\n   120\t\n   121\tThis is just the beginning. We plan to expand these capabilities in future releases and would love to hear your feedback and ideas on what you'd like to see.\n   122\t\n   123\t### Using MCP Outside Cursor\n   124\t\n   125\tIf you want to use our MCP integration with other tools that support the protocol (like Claude Desktop, Cline, Windsurf and more), you can run it in `stdio` mode. This allows direct communication between the client and server process. Follow the instructions in the [nx-mcp npm package documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nx-mcp?activeTab=readme) to set this up.\n   126\t\n   127\t## Let's see it in action\n   128\t\n   129\tThe [Youtube video]() above showcases the below example queries, showing how Cursor leverages the different exposed Nx MCP tools to get more information to correctly take action.\n   130\t\n   131\t- If I change the public API of feat-product-detail, which other projects might be affected by that change?\n   132\t- Use Nx to generate a new React library for handling past orders.\n   133\t- Can you configure Nx release for the packages of this workspace?

Discover proven workflows, best practices, and strategies that transform AI from a novelty into a powerful development multiplier.'\n     8\t---\n     9\t\n    10\t> _\"Tools amplify your talent. The better your skills, the better the tools serve you.\"_ — Andrew Hunt, The Pragmatic Programmer\n    11\t\n    12\t_This is the first post in the series. Much of it aggregates the insights of colleagues at Nx (Juri Strumpflohner, James Henry, and others)\n    13\tand other developers I frequently discuss this topic with (special thanks to Matt Briggs, who is a de-facto co-author of this post)._\n    14\t\n    15\t**The main takeaway from this guide**: Being intentional and investing in workflows instead of just \"using Cursor\" or \"chatting with GPT\" is what separates effective AI-assisted development from impressive demos that don't translate to real productivity gains.\n    16\t\n    17\tAI can supercharge your development process, but it's not a magic wand. It's like learning to use power tools - requiring practice to master but transformative once you do. The difference between developers who get 10-30% productivity gains and those who struggle with AI comes down to **having proper procedures and workflows** rather than shooting random prompts at their LLM.\n    18\t\n    19\t{% toc /%}\n    20\t\n    21\t## Setting Realistic Expectations\n    22\t\n    23\tAI can enhance your development process significantly. It's useful for:\n    24\t\n    25\t- Coding\n    26\t- Thinking\n    27\t- Content creation\n    28\t- Learning\n    29\t\n    30\tDepending on the company you work at and your position, how you use AI will be drastically different. A web developer at a startup spends much of their day coding. A VP at a financial organization may not have written code in years and would benefit more from content creation and thinking. Regardless, you'll find useful patterns here.\n    31\t\n    32\tFor software engineers, expected outcomes with proper AI implementation:\n    33\t\n    34\t- Faster coding on real projects (10-30% in my personal experience)\n    35\t- Faster content creation (30-50% in my personal experience)\n    36\t- Improved code quality\n    37\t- Accelerated skill acquisition\n    38\t\n    39\tGetting there requires patience and experimentation. We're all figuring this out together as tools improve every few months. No one has mastered AI-assisted development yet. Give yourself room to build this skill - the learning curve is real but worth climbing.\n    40\t\n    41\tHowever, set your expectations right. **The total output of your team won't go up by 30%, especially in large organizations.** Engineers in large organizations spend only a fraction of their time coding, creating content, and learning new skills. Smaller teams will get much more leverage out of using AI.\n    42\t\n    43\t## Tool Categories, Agents and Some Recommendations\n    44\t\n    45\tThe AI space is awash with investment, making any list quickly outdated. Effective workflows typically combine tools from multiple categories.\n    46\t\n    47\t### Main Tool Categories\n    48\t\n    49\t- **AI-integrated Editors** - VSCode, Cursor, Windsurf, Roo Code, Intellij, Zed. Most developers' primary coding environment with integrated AI capabilities.\n    50\t- **Terminal-based AI Agents** - Claude Code, Codex, Aider. Command-line tools for delegating coding tasks directly from terminal.\n    51\t- **Dedicated Web/Desktop Applications** - Offer unrestricted model capabilities and features like research agents and web search, despite lacking codebase context.\n    52\t- **Cloud-based Agents** - Devin, Copilot, Codex. Finally reaching reliability for simple task delegation on real projects.\n    53\t- **Code Review Tools** - Graphite Diamond, Copilot. Provide early PR feedback and are increasingly useful.\n    54\t\n    55\tFor tasks outside specific coding work - research, planning, documentation, and general problem-solving - I rely on dedicated web/desktop applications that offer broader capabilities:\n    56\t\n    57\t- **Claude Desktop** - Large context, web search, research capabilities, robust MCP support (some features require expensive Claude Max)\n    58\t- **ChatGPT** - Image creation, superior web search, research capabilities (less code-proficient than competitors)\n    59\t- **AI Studio (Gemini)** - Massive context window, code-optimized models, Google search integration\n    60\t- **T3 Chat** - A fast web-based chat client that allows you to switch between multiple models and comes with a competitive, convenient pricing approach.\n    61\t- **ChatWise** - A desktop-based chat client that uses a bring-your-own-key strategy, allowing you to integrate with all the models out there. You can provision a key via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) or directly plug in the key.\n    62\t\n    63\tAll five are comparable - consistency matters more than choice. I personally value MCP integrations, so primarily use Claude Desktop.\n    64\t\n    65\t**Model Control Protocols (MCPs)** are plug-and-play tools that AI can use to fulfill requests. They're remarkably quick to create and integrate with most agent-based tools and Claude desktop. MCPs are particularly valuable as they can enhance any of the above tool categories, providing specialized capabilities and integrations that extend the base functionality of AI coding assistants. This is exactly how we integrate Nx's capabilities with existing coding assistants like VS Code Copilot and Cursor - [learn more about our MCP implementation](/blog/nx-mcp-vscode-copilot).\n    66\t\n    67\t### Agent Types\n    68\t\n    69\tThe most important type of tool you would use while coding is an Agent. Most of the AI work you do in Cursor, Windsurf or JetBrains is done via Agents. You can chat with agents to instruct it to do several things to your code base. Agents have built-in capabilities (integrating with your editor) and can be extended via MCP.\n    70\t\n    71\t**There are two styles of agents:** interactive and non-interactive\n    72\t\n    73\t### Interactive Agents (Quick Doers)\n    74\t\n    75\tThese are your everyday workhorses for AI-assisted coding. They're quick, cost-effective, but with some capability limitations.\n    76\t\n    77\t**Recommended options:**\n    78\t\n    79\t- **Cursor** (VSCode fork)\n    80\t- **Windsurf** (Available as VSCode fork or JetBrains plugin)\n    81\t- **Copilot** (VSCode native integration; almost as effective as Cursor/Windsurf and improving fast)\n    82\t\n    83\t### Non-interactive Agents (Deep Thinkers)\n    84\t\n    85\tMore precise than interactive assistants but slower and pricier - like precision power tools versus hand tools. These excel at widespread codebase changes requiring sub-agents or extensive context.\n    86\t\n    87\t**Recommended options:**\n    88\t\n    89\t- **Claude Code** (terminal-based interface)\n    90\t- **OpenAI Codex** (terminal-based interface)\n    91\t- **JetBrains Junie**\n    92\t\n    93\tThey get less attention online because most streamers do work that works well with interactive agents. Any agent can put together a web page. \"Deep Thinkers\" can spend many minutes performing an operation which doesn't make for impressive videos, but they're very valuable when working on real complex systems.\n    94\t\n    95\tMost of my work involves distributed systems, where interactive agents aren't particularly effective. In these systems, application behavior isn't easily derivable from source code—things operate at a higher level of abstraction.\n    96\t\n    97\tI get significantly more leverage from tools like Claude Code (or Junie) than Cursor/Copilot, which create more robust plans and provide real value in my domain. Even with Claude Code I use specific patterns and prompt and keep it on a short leash.\n    98\t\n    99\tFor tasks like writing new scripts or building web UIs, I find Copilot or Cursor work better.\n   100\t\n   101\t## The Main Rule: Understanding over Speed\n   102\t\n   103\t> Never commit code you don't understand.\n   104\t\n   105\tWhile AI may write it, you are responsible for every character. Understanding your code completely is essential. Read, understand, investigate the code that AI generates.\n   106\t\n   107\tIf AI generates subpar code, it's your duty to improve it and learn how to get better results. The goal is AI that produces what you would have written yourself.\n   108\t\n   109\t**Effective AI use means:**\n   110\t\n   111\t- More thinking and reading\n   112\t- Less typing\n   113\t\n   114\tThese tools create space for better engineering practices - not just cramming in more features. **Critical thinking and deep codebase familiarity remain essential. They're the foundation for effective AI use.**\n   115\t\n   116\t### Beyond \"Vibing\" with AI\n   117\t\n   118\tAI is much better at being impressive compared to being correct. There's a lot of excitement in creating quick prototypes using AI without understanding what the code does. This can be useful but it is not software engineering. It's closer to sketching, wireframing, exploring.\n   119\t\n   120\tAlthough impressive demos get attention, the vast majority of effort is spent on non-prototypes. And there is a lot more gain to be had in optimizing actual engineering workflows.\n   121\t\n   122\t## The Core Workflow\n   123\t\n   124\tThe most effective AI-assisted development follows a structured approach: **Plan → Act → Review → Repeat**. This isn't just good practice - it's essential for avoiding the common pitfalls that lead to frustration and wasted time.\n   125\t\n   126\t### Plan\n   127\t\n   128\t![Planning Phase Workflow](/blog/images/articles/ai-flow-planning-phase.avif)\n   129\t\n   130\tKeep the agent in discussion mode - no code execution yet. Provide necessary context. For complex features, thorough planning preserves the necessary context between executions. Most tasks don't require this depth, but skipping planning virtually guarantees poor results.\n   131\t\n   132\tPlanning needs substantial context. This is where tools like [Nx's AI integration](/features/enhance-AI) shine by providing agents with derived context about your codebase architecture, team responsibilities, and organizational boundaries. All of these helps LLMs and humans operate from the same architectural and organizational context.\n   133\t\n   134\tFor large changes, it's a good idea to persist the created plan to disk.\n   135\t\n   136\t### Act\n   137\t\n   138\t![Acting Phase Workflow](/blog/images/articles/ai-flow-acting-phase.avif)\n   139\t\n   140\tRelease the agent to execute the plan.\n   141\tStay engaged. Monitor execution and check work in progress. Halt immediately if problems arise or new information emerges, then return to planning.\n   142\t\n   143\tAgents can get stuck. If this happens, restart them. An Agent's effectiveness increases dramatically when it can use higher-level operations. Without these, ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices becomes much harder.\n   144\t\n   145\tThis primarily affects real organizations, not demo projects, as demos don't need to be correct or follow best practices. That was a big focus for us when developing Nx MCP (which provides many tools that help guarantee consistency and compliance with standards) because of us working with a lot of large companies with 1000s of engineers working in the same org.\n   146\t\n   147\tAgents excel at being almost right but struggle with executing exactly what's required. Good interactions should include requesting user input for high-impact operations that are difficult to adjust later (like creating a new package). For instance, when using Nx, an Agent would open a UI with pre-filled generator options that users can modify and confirm. The Agent then continues the work from that point.

Discover proven workflows, best practices, and strategies that transform AI from a novelty into a powerful development multiplier.'\n---\n\n> _\"Tools amplify your talent. The better your skills, the better the tools serve you.\"_ — Andrew Hunt, The Pragmatic Programmer\n\n_This is the first post in the series. Much of it aggregates the insights of colleagues at Nx (Juri Strumpflohner, James Henry, and others)\nand other developers I frequently discuss this topic with (special thanks to Matt Briggs, who is a de-facto co-author of this post)._\n\n**The main takeaway from this guide**: Being intentional and investing in workflows instead of just \"using Cursor\" or \"chatting with GPT\" is what separates effective AI-assisted development from impressive demos that don't translate to real productivity gains.\n\nAI can supercharge your development process, but it's not a magic wand. It's like learning to use power tools - requiring practice to master but transformative once you do. The difference between developers who get 10-30% productivity gains and those who struggle with AI comes down to **having proper procedures and workflows** rather than shooting random prompts at their LLM.\n\n{% toc /%}\n\n## Setting Realistic Expectations\n\nAI can enhance your development process significantly. It's useful for:\n\n- Coding\n- Thinking\n- Content creation\n- Learning\n\nDepending on the company you work at and your position, how you use AI will be drastically different. A web developer at a startup spends much of their day coding. A VP at a financial organization may not have written code in years and would benefit more from content creation and thinking. Regardless, you'll find useful patterns here.\n\nFor software engineers, expected outcomes with proper AI implementation:\n\n- Faster coding on real projects (10-30% in my personal experience)\n- Faster content creation (30-50% in my personal experience)\n- Improved code quality\n- Accelerated skill acquisition\n\nGetting there requires patience and experimentation. We're all figuring this out together as tools improve every few months. No one has mastered AI-assisted development yet. Give yourself room to build this skill - the learning curve is real but worth climbing.\n\nHowever, set your expectations right. **The total output of your team won't go up by 30%, especially in large organizations.** Engineers in large organizations spend only a fraction of their time coding, creating content, and learning new skills. Smaller teams will get much more leverage out of using AI.\n\n## Tool Categories, Agents and Some Recommendations\n\nThe AI space is awash with investment, making any list quickly outdated. Effective workflows typically combine tools from multiple categories.\n\n### Main Tool Categories\n\n- **AI-integrated Editors** - VSCode, Cursor, Windsurf, Roo Code, Intellij, Zed. Most developers' primary coding environment with integrated AI capabilities.\n- **Terminal-based AI Agents** - Claude Code, Codex, Aider. Command-line tools for delegating coding tasks directly from terminal.\n- **Dedicated Web/Desktop Applications** - Offer unrestricted model capabilities and features like research agents and web search, despite lacking codebase context.\n- **Cloud-based Agents** - Devin, Copilot, Codex. Finally reaching reliability for simple task delegation on real projects.\n- **Code Review Tools** - Graphite Diamond, Copilot. Provide early PR feedback and are increasingly useful.\n\nFor tasks outside specific coding work - research, planning, documentation, and general problem-solving - I rely on dedicated web/desktop applications that offer broader capabilities:\n\n- **Claude Desktop** - Large context, web search, research capabilities, robust MCP support (some features require expensive Claude Max)\n- **ChatGPT** - Image creation, superior web search, research capabilities (less code-proficient than competitors)\n- **AI Studio (Gemini)** - Massive context window, code-optimized models, Google search integration\n- **T3 Chat** - A fast web-based chat client that allows you to switch between multiple models and comes with a competitive, convenient pricing approach.\n- **ChatWise** - A desktop-based chat client that uses a bring-your-own-key strategy, allowing you to integrate with all the models out there. You can provision a key via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) or directly plug in the key.\n\nAll five are comparable - consistency matters more than choice. I personally value MCP integrations, so primarily use Claude Desktop.\n\n**Model Control Protocols (MCPs)** are plug-and-play tools that AI can use to fulfill requests. They're remarkably quick to create and integrate with most agent-based tools and Claude desktop. MCPs are particularly valuable as they can enhance any of the above tool categories, providing specialized capabilities and integrations that extend the base functionality of AI coding assistants. This is exactly how we integrate Nx's capabilities with existing coding assistants like VS Code Copilot and Cursor - [learn more about our MCP implementation](/blog/nx-mcp-vscode-copilot).\n\n### Agent Types\n\nThe most important type of tool you would use while coding is an Agent. Most of the AI work you do in Cursor, Windsurf or JetBrains is done via Agents. You can chat with agents to instruct it to do several things to your code base. Agents have built-in capabilities (integrating with your editor) and can be extended via MCP.\n\n**There are two styles of agents:** interactive and non-interactive\n\n### Interactive Agents (Quick Doers)\n\nThese are your everyday workhorses for AI-assisted coding. They're quick, cost-effective, but with some capability limitations.\n\n**Recommended options:**\n\n- **Cursor** (VSCode fork)\n- **Windsurf** (Available as VSCode fork or JetBrains plugin)\n- **Copilot** (VSCode native integration; almost as effective as Cursor/Windsurf and improving fast)\n\n### Non-interactive Agents (Deep Thinkers)\n\nMore precise than interactive assistants but slower and pricier - like precision power tools versus hand tools. These excel at widespread codebase changes requiring sub-agents or extensive context.\n\n**Recommended options:**\n\n- **Claude Code** (terminal-based interface)\n- **OpenAI Codex** (terminal-based interface)\n- **JetBrains Junie**\n\nThey get less attention online because most streamers do work that works well with interactive agents. Any agent can put together a web page. \"Deep Thinkers\" can spend many minutes performing an operation which doesn't make for impressive videos, but they're very valuable when working on real complex systems.\n\nMost of my work involves distributed systems, where interactive agents aren't particularly effective. In these systems, application behavior isn't easily derivable from source code—things operate at a higher level of abstraction.\n\nI get significantly more leverage from tools like Claude Code (or Junie) than Cursor/Copilot, which create more robust plans and provide real value in my domain. Even with Claude Code I use specific patterns and prompt and keep it on a short leash.\n\nFor tasks like writing new scripts or building web UIs, I find Copilot or Cursor work better.\n\n## The Main Rule: Understanding over Speed\n\n> Never commit code you don't understand.\n\nWhile AI may write it, you are responsible for every character. Understanding your code completely is essential. Read, understand, investigate the code that AI generates.\n\nIf AI generates subpar code, it's your duty to improve it and learn how to get better results. The goal is AI that produces what you would have written yourself.\n\n**Effective AI use means:**\n\n- More thinking and reading\n- Less typing\n\nThese tools create space for better engineering practices - not just cramming in more features. **Critical thinking and deep codebase familiarity remain essential. They're the foundation for effective AI use.**\n\n### Beyond \"Vibing\" with AI\n\nAI is much better at being impressive compared to being correct. There's a lot of excitement in creating quick prototypes using AI without understanding what the code does. This can be useful but it is not software engineering. It's closer to sketching, wireframing, exploring.\n\nAlthough impressive demos get attention, the vast majority of effort is spent on non-prototypes. And there is a lot more gain to be had in optimizing actual engineering workflows.\n\n## The Core Workflow\n\nThe most effective AI-assisted development follows a structured approach: **Plan → Act → Review → Repeat**. This isn't just good practice - it's essential for avoiding the common pitfalls that lead to frustration and wasted time.\n\n### Plan\n\n![Planning Phase Workflow](/blog/images/articles/ai-flow-planning-phase.avif)\n\nKeep the agent in discussion mode - no code execution yet. Provide necessary context. For complex features, thorough planning preserves the necessary context between executions. Most tasks don't require this depth, but skipping planning virtually guarantees poor results.\n\nPlanning needs substantial context. This is where tools like [Nx's AI integration](/features/enhance-AI) shine by providing agents with derived context about your codebase architecture, team responsibilities, and organizational boundaries. All of these helps LLMs and humans operate from the same architectural and organizational context.\n\nFor large changes, it's a good idea to persist the created plan to disk.\n\n### Act\n\n![Acting Phase Workflow](/blog/images/articles/ai-flow-acting-phase.avif)\n\nRelease the agent to execute the plan.\nStay engaged. Monitor execution and check work in progress. Halt immediately if problems arise or new information emerges, then return to planning.\n\nAgents can get stuck. If this happens, restart them. An Agent's effectiveness increases dramatically when it can use higher-level operations. Without these, ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices becomes much harder.\n\nThis primarily affects real organizations, not demo projects, as demos don't need to be correct or follow best practices. That was a big focus for us when developing Nx MCP (which provides many tools that help guarantee consistency and compliance with standards) because of us working with a lot of large companies with 1000s of engineers working in the same org.\n\nAgents excel at being almost right but struggle with executing exactly what's required. Good interactions should include requesting user input for high-impact operations that are difficult to adjust later (like creating a new package). For instance, when using Nx, an Agent would open a UI with pre-filled generator options that users can modify and confirm. The Agent then continues the work from that point. Have a look at our [latest blog post for a deeper dive into what this looks like](/blog/nx-generators-ai-integration).\n\nIf things go sideways, don't hesitate to reset: dump context, revert changes, and start fresh. These tools drastically reduce \"grunt work\" costs, making restarts practical.\n\n### Review\n\n![Review Phase Workflow](/blog/images/articles/ai-flow-review-phase.avif)\n\nEven though I try to keep a document where I note things that will require a follow-up, most likely won't keep pace with the agent's output. That's why it's important to do thorough review afterward. Make small changes directly or ask the agent to make them.\n\n### Repeat\n\nThe process is rarely linear and often varies, but follows this general pattern.\n\n**Common mistakes**: skipping either \"Plan\" or \"Repeat\" - both are essential. Do not skip them when working on real projects.\n\n## Using Rules and Persistent Context\n\nEvery AI coding assistant offers automatic prompt inclusion: Cursor rules, Windsurf rules etc. These are essential for consistent output.\n\nKeep it manageable - a few hundred lines work well. Your rules should document coding style, recurring patterns, and architecture. If you repeat yourself during development, encode it in rules.\n\nFor persistent prompts, create a human-readable version and let AI optimize it for machines. AI excels at prompt engineering - focus on tweaking, not creating from scratch.\n\n### Example Workflow for Rules\n\n1. Create `STANDARDS.md` with coding standards\n2. Review with AI and request clarifications\n3. Identify gaps and address them\n4. Format standards appropriately\n5. Update rules files\n\n### For Working on Features\n\nMaintain a `PR.md` at project root. Start with issue instructions and update it with any relevant information about the PR you are working on. Use AI as pair programmer, rubber duck, and technical writer - handling grunt work while you focus on complex thinking.\n\nWith your feature document ready, you can instantly provide context in any chat. Create implementation steps and save the checklist in `PR.md` or in a separate file.\n\nStart separate chats for each step, checking off as you complete them. Remain flexible when pivots become necessary.\n\nThese techniques amplify what great programmers already do, but AI assistance makes these practices significantly more powerful.\n\n## Quick Recommendations\n\n### Code Quality & Documentation\n\n- Maintain consistent code style - AI generates better matches when surrounding code is well-formatted\n- Use AI to document - documentation costs drop 10x with AI assistance\n- Leverage AI for planning - preparation costs decrease drastically\n\n### Debugging\n\n- Always plan/ask before fixing - avoid tunnel vision and loops\n- When encountering errors, follow this sequence:\n  1. Ask \"What broke? Why?\" and paste the stack trace\n  2. If response makes sense, request \"List 1-3 solutions that could fix this problem\"\n- Be aware that AI excels at stack trace analysis but can get stuck in loops when autonomously fixing test failures\n\n### Session Management\n\n- Commit code frequently to create recovery checkpoints\n- Keep chat sessions short to prevent instruction forgetting and context drift\n- Start fresh chats for each issue/task\n- For lengthy sessions, request a summary before starting a new chat\n\n### Task Structure\n\n- Avoid building large features in single attempts\n- Plan first, then divide into incremental tasks\n- Keep individual tasks straightforward and simple\n- Focus on iterative tasks - AI performs better with focused objectives\n\n### Coding Approach\n\n- Avoid clever solutions - stay within community idioms\n- Remember AI performs pattern matching - code resembling internet examples gets better results\n- Use interactive agents for implementation, not questions\n- Seek answers in web interfaces or higher-quality agents before implementation\n- Learn to distinguish routine vs. non-routine tasks and adjust your approach accordingly\n\n## Handling Hallucinations\n\nHallucinations are one of the biggest issues with LLMs. You'll develop instincts for when you're in risky territory - like when AI suggests a perfect-sounding method that doesn't actually exist.\n\nAI excels at inventing plausible solutions that match a library's style but aren't implemented, especially with less mainstream libraries.

Think of it as an interactive Wikipedia or Stack Overflow, custom-tailored to your specific learning needs.\n\nUnlike static resources, AI enables true dialogue. You can:\n\n- Ask questions in any format\n- Request simplified explanations when confused\n- Test your understanding by explaining concepts back\n- Take personalized quizzes\n- Receive evaluations of your comprehension\n- Get recommendations for logical next learning steps\n\nWhile AI doesn't replace a well-crafted book, it surpasses most online learning content.
