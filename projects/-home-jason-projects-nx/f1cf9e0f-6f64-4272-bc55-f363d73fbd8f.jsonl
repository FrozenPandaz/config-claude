Provide a detailed analysis of the issue\n2. Create a comprehensive implementation plan\n3. Break down the solution into clear steps\n4. Then please post the plan as a comment on the issue\n\n### Immediate Implementation Mode\n\nUse this approach when users ask you to:\n\n- \"fix\", \"implement\", \"solve\", \"build\", \"create\", \"update\", or \"add\"\n- Or when they explicitly request immediate action\n\nIn this mode:\n\n1. Analyze the issue quickly\n2. Implement the complete solution immediately\n3. Make all necessary code changes. Please make multiple commits so that the changes are easier to review.\n4. Run appropriate tests and validation\n5. If the tests, are not passing, please fix the issues and continue doing this up to 3 more times until the tests pass\n6. Once the tests pass, push a branch and then suggest opening a PR which has a description of the changes made, and that\n   it make sure that it explicitly says \"Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER\" to automatically close the issue when the PR is merged.\n\n## Avoid making changes to generated files\n\nFiles under `generated` directories are generated based on a different source file and should not be modified directly.\nFind the underlying source and modify that instead.\n\n## Essential Commands\n\n### Code Formatting\n\nAfter code changes are made, please make sure to format the files with prettier via `npx prettier -- FILE_NAME`\n\n### Pre-push Validation\n\n```bash\n# Full validation suite - run before committing\npnpm nx prepush\n```\n\nIf the prepush validation suite fails, please fix the issues before proceeding with your work. This ensures that all code adheres to the project's standards and passes all tests.\n\n### Testing Changes\n\nAfter code changes are made, first test the specific project where the changes were made:\n\n```bash\nnx run-many -t test,build,lint -p PROJECT_NAME\n```\n\nAfter verifying the individual project, validate that the changes in projects which have been affected:\n\n```bash\n# Test only affected projects (recommended for development)\nnx affected -t build,test,lint\n```\n\nAs the last step, run the e2e tests to fully ensure that changes are valid:\n\n```bash\n# Run affected e2e tests (recommended for development)\nnx affected -t e2e-local\n```\n\n## Fixing GitHub Issues\n\nWhen working on a GitHub issue, follow this systematic approach:\n\n### 1. Get Issue Details\n\n```bash\n# Get issue details using GitHub CLI (replace ISSUE_NUMBER with actual number)\ngh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER\n```\n\nWhen cloning reproduction repos, please clone within `./tmp/claude/repro-ISSUE_NUMBER`\n\n### 2. Analyze the Plan\n\n- Look for a plan or implementation details in the issue description\n- Check comments for additional context or clarification\n- Identify affected projects and components\n\n### 3. Implement the Solution\n\n- Follow the plan outlined in the issue\n- Make focused changes that address the specific problem\n- Ensure code follows existing patterns and conventions\n\n### 4. Run Full Validation\n\n```bash\n# Test specific affected projects first\nnx run-many -t test,build,lint -p PROJECT_NAME\n\n# Test all affected projects\nnx affected -t build,test,lint\n\n# Run affected e2e tests\nnx affected -t e2e-local\n\n# Final pre-push validation\npnpm nx prepush\n```\n\n### 5. Submit Pull Request\n\n- Create a descriptive PR title that references the issue\n- Include \"Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER\" in the PR description\n- Provide a clear summary of changes made\n- Request appropriate reviewers\n\n## Pull Request Template\n\nWhen creating a pull request, follow the template found in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. The template includes:\n\n### Required Sections\n\n1. **Current Behavior**: Describe the behavior we have today\n2. **Expected Behavior**: Describe the behavior we should expect with the changes in this PR\n3. **Related Issue(s)**: Link the issue being fixed so it gets closed when the PR is merged\n\n### Template Format\n\n```markdown\n## Current Behavior\n\n<!-- This is the behavior we have today -->\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n<!-- This is the behavior we should expect with the changes in this PR -->\n\n## Related Issue(s)\n\n<!-- Please link the issue being fixed so it gets closed when this is merged. -->\n\nFixes #ISSUE_NUMBER\n```\n\n### Guidelines\n\n- Ensure your commit message follows the conventional commit format (use `pnpm commit`)\n- Read the submission guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md before posting\n- For complex changes, you can request a dedicated Nx release by mentioning the Nx team\n- Always link the related issue using \"Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER\" to automatically close it when merged\n","numLines":188,"startLine":1,"totalLines":188}}}
