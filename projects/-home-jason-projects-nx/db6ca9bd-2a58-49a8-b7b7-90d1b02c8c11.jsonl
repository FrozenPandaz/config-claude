Detailed analysis\n2. Comprehensive implementation plan\n3. Clear step breakdown\n4. Post plan as issue comment\n\n### Immediate Implementation Mode\nTriggered by: \"fix\", \"implement\", \"solve\", \"build\", \"create\", \"update\", \"add\"\n1. Quick analysis\n2. Complete solution implementation\n3. Multiple commits for easier review\n4. Test validation (up to 3 retry attempts)\n5.
