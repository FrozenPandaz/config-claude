If you are a WebStorm user, make sure to mark this folder as excluded.\n    40\t\n    41\t## Technologies\n    42\t\n    43\tThis repo contains a mix of different technologies, including:\n    44\t\n    45\t- **Rust**: The core of Nx is written in Rust, which provides performance and safety.\n    46\t- **TypeScript**: The primary language for Nx packages and the Nx DevKit.\n    47\t- **Kotlin**: Used for the Gradle and Java plugins.\n    48\t\n    49\t## Development Workstation Setup\n    50\t\n    51\tIf you are using `VSCode`, and provided you have [Docker](https://docker.com) installed on your machine, then you can leverage [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev) through this [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers), to easily setup your development environment, with everything needed to contribute to Nx, already installed (namely `NodeJS`, `Yarn`, `Rust`, `Cargo`, plus some useful extensions like `Nx Console`).\n    52\t\n    53\tTo do so, simply:\n    54\t\n    55\t- Checkout the repo\n    56\t- Open it with VSCode\n    57\t- Open the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) and select \"Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...\"\n    58\t\n    59\tThe repo comes with a preconfigured `devcontainer.json` file (located in `.devcontainer/` folder at root), that `VSCode` will automatically use to install the aforementioned tools, inside a Docker image. It will even run `pnpm install` for you, so you can start contributing to Nx right after.\n    60\t\n    61\tIf you open the repo in [Github Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces), it will also leverage this config file, to setup the codespace, with the same required tools.\n    62\t\n    63\t> 💡 **Troubleshooting**\n    64\t>\n    65\t> If you are having issues when running Nx commands like `build`, `test`... related to the version of `GLIBC`,\n    66\t> it probably means the version that is installed on the devcontainer, **is outdated** compare to the minimum version required by Nx tools.\n    67\t>\n    68\t> You can check currently installed version by running the following command, in a terminal within the container:\n    69\t>\n    70\t> `ldd --version`\n    71\t>\n    72\t> Then, try updating the base image used in [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) and rebuild it, to see if it solved the issue.\n    73\t>\n    74\t> Current base image is `\"mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:20-bookworm\"` which is based on `Debian-12 (bookworm)`,\n    75\t> which comes with `GLIBC v2.36` pre-installed (Nx tools currenlty requires `GLIBC v2.33` or higher).\n    76\t\n    77\t## Building the Project\n    78\t\n    79\t> 💡 Nx uses `Rust` to build native bindings for Node. Please make sure that you have Rust installed via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)\n    80\t> If you have `VSCode` + `Docker`, this can be automated for you, see [section](#development-workstation-setup) above\n    81\t\n    82\tAfter cloning the project to your machine, to install the dependencies, run:\n    83\t\n    84\t```bash\n    85\tpnpm install\n    86\t\n    87\t// or prefer...\n    88\t\n    89\tpnpm install --frozen-lockfile // if you haven't changed any dependency\n    90\t```\n    91\t\n    92\tTo build all the packages, run:\n    93\t\n    94\t```bash\n    95\tpnpm build\n    96\t```\n    97\t\n    98\t## Publishing to a local registry\n    99\t\n   100\tTo test if your changes will actually work once the changes are published,\n   101\tit can be useful to publish to a local registry.\n   102\t\n   103\tCheck out [this video for a live walkthrough](https://youtu.be/Tx257WpNsxc) or follow the instructions below:\n   104\t\n   105\t- Run `pnpm local-registry` in Terminal 1 (keep it running)\n   106\t- Run `npm adduser --registry http://localhost:4873` in Terminal 2 (real credentials are not required, you just need to\n   107\t  be logged in. You can use test/test/test@test.io.)\n   108\t- Run `pnpm nx-release 20.0.0 --local` in Terminal 2 - you can choose any nonexistent version number here, but it's recommended to use the next major\n   109\t- Run `cd ./tmp` in Terminal 2\n   110\t- Run `npx create-nx-workspace@20.0.0` in Terminal 2\n   111\t\n   112\tIf you have problems publishing, make sure you use Node 18 and NPM 8.\n   113\t\n   114\t**NOTE:** To use this newly published local version, you need to make a new workspace, run `nx migrate` or change all of your target packages to this new version, eg: `\"nx\": \"^20.0.0\",` and re-run `pnpm i` in your testing project.\n   115\t\n   116\t### Publishing for Yarn 2+ (Berry)\n   117\t\n   118\tYarn Berry operates slightly differently than Yarn Classic. In order to publish packages for Berry follow next steps:\n   119\t\n   120\t- Run `yarn set version berry` to switch to latest Yarn version.\n   121\t- Create `.yarnrc.yml` in root with following contents:\n   122\t\n   123\t  ```yml\n   124\t  nodeLinker: node-modules\n   125\t  npmRegistryServer: 'http://localhost:4873'\n   126\t  unsafeHttpWhitelist:\n   127\t    - localhost\n   128\t  ```\n   129\t\n   130\t- Run `pnpm local-registry` in Terminal 1 (keep it running)\n   131\t- If you are creating nx workspace outside of your nx repo, make sure to add npm registry info to your root yarnrc (\n   132\t  usually in ~/.yarnrc.yml). The file should look something like this:\n   133\t\n   134\t  ```yml\n   135\t  npmRegistries:\n   136\t    'https://registry.yarnpkg.com':\n   137\t      npmAuthToken: npm_******************\n   138\t  yarnPath: .yarn/releases/yarn-3.2.2.cjs\n   139\t  npmRegistryServer: 'http://localhost:4873'\n   140\t  unsafeHttpWhitelist:\n   141\t    - localhost\n   142\t  ```\n   143\t\n   144\t- Run `pnpm nx-release minor --local` in Terminal 2 to publish next minor version. The output will report the version of published packages.\n   145\t- Go to your target folder (e.g. `cd ./tmp`) in Terminal 2\n   146\t- Run `yarn dlx create-nx-workspace@123.4.5` in Terminal 2 (replace `123.4.5` with the version that got published).\n   147\t\n   148\t### Running Unit Tests\n   149\t\n   150\tTo make sure your changes do not break any unit tests, run the following:\n   151\t\n   152\t```bash\n   153\tnx affected --target=test\n   154\t```\n   155\t\n   156\tFor example, if you need to only run the tests for the jest package, run:\n   157\t\n   158\t```bash\n   159\tnx test jest\n   160\t```\n   161\t\n   162\t### Running E2E Tests\n   163\t\n   164\t**Use Node 18 and NPM 8. E2E tests won't work on Node 15 and NPM 7.**\n   165\t\n   166\tTo make sure your changes do not break any E2E tests, run:\n   167\t\n   168\t```bash\n   169\tnx e2e e2e-vite # or any other project here\n   170\t```\n   171\t\n   172\tRunning E2E tests can take some time, so it is often useful to run a single test. To run a single suite of tests, run:\n   173\t\n   174\t```bash\n   175\tnx e2e e2e-vite -t versions # I often add qqqq to my test name so I can use -t qqqq\n   176\t```\n   177\t\n   178\tSometimes tests pass locally but they fail on the CI. To reproduce the CI environment and be able to debug the issue, run:\n   179\t\n   180\t```bash\n   181\tNX_VERBOSE_LOGGING=true CI=true SELECTED_PM=pnpm pnpm nx e2e e2e-vite --t=\"should do something is this test\"\n   182\t```\n   183\t\n   184\tThe above command sets verbose logging (this exposes stack traces and underlying errors), sets the defaults to be CI-like and sets Pnpm as the selected package manager.\n   185\t\n   186\t### Developing on Windows\n   187\t\n   188\tTo build Nx on Windows, you need to use WSL.\n   189\t\n   190\t- Run `pnpm install` in WSL. Yarn will compile several dependencies. If you don't run `install` in WSL, they will be\n   191\t  compiled for Windows.\n   192\t- Run `nx affected --target=test` and other commands in WSL.\n   193\t\n   194\t## Documentation Contributions\n   195\t\n   196\tWe would love for you to contribute to our documentation as well!

An issue for your problem may already exist and has been\n   273\tresolved, or the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.\n   274\t\n   275\tWe want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. Having a\n   276\treproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back and forth with you requiring\n   277\tadditional information, such as:\n   278\t\n   279\t- the output of `nx report`\n   280\t- `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`\n   281\t- and most importantly - a use-case that fails\n   282\t\n   283\tA minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we are\n   284\tfixing the right problem.\n   285\t\n   286\tWe will be insisting on a minimal reproduction in order to save maintainers' time and ultimately be able to fix more\n   287\tbugs. Interestingly, from our experience, users often find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal\n   288\treproduction repository. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essentials bits of code from a larger\n   289\tcodebase, but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.\n   290\t\n   291\tYou can file new issues by filling out our [issue form](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/new/choose).\n   292\t\n   293\t### <a name=\"submit-pr\"></a> Submitting a PR\n   294\t\n   295\tPlease follow the following guidelines:\n   296\t\n   297\t- Make sure unit tests pass (`nx affected --target=test`)\n   298\t  - Target a specific project with: `nx run proj:test` (i.e. `nx run angular:test` to target `packages/angular`)\n   299\t  - Target a specific unit test file (i.e. `packages/angular/src/utils/ast-command-line-utils.spec.ts`)\n   300\t    with `npx jest angular/src/utils/ast-utils` or `npx jest packages/angular/src/utils/ast-utils`\n   301\t  - For more options on running tests - check `npx jest --help` or visit [jestjs.io](https://jestjs.io/)\n   302\t  - Debug with `node --inspect-brk ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js build/packages/angular/src/utils/ast-utils.spec.js`\n   303\t- Make sure e2e tests pass (this can take a while, so you can always let CI check those) (`nx affected --target=e2e`)\n   304\t  - Target a specific e2e test with `nx e2e e2e-cypress`\n   305\t- Make sure you run `nx format`\n   306\t- Update documentation with `pnpm documentation`.

Using the `nrwl` tag\non [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nrwl) is a much better place to ask general questions\nabout how to use Nx.\n\n## Found an Issue?\n\nIf you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us\nby [submitting an issue](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit-issue)\nto [our GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nrwl/nx). Even better, you\ncan [submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit-pr) with a fix.\n\n## Project Structure\n\nSource code and documentation are included in the top-level folders listed below.\n\n- `packages` - Source code for Nx packages such as Angular, React, Web, NestJS, Next and others including generators and\n  executors (or builders).\n- `e2e` - E2E tests for the Nx packages\n- `graph` - Source code for the Nx Graph application which shows the project graph, task graph, project details, and more in the browser.\n- `docs` - Markdown and configuration files for documentation including tutorials, guides for each supported platform,\n  and API docs.\n- `nx-dev` - Source code for the Nx documentation site which displays the markdown in `docs` and more.\n- `tools` - Workspace-specific tooling and plugins\n- `scripts` - Miscellaneous scripts for project tasks such as building documentation, testing, and code formatting.\n- `tmp` - Folder used by e2e tests. If you are a WebStorm user, make sure to mark this folder as excluded.\n\n## Technologies\n\nThis repo contains a mix of different technologies, including:\n\n- **Rust**: The core of Nx is written in Rust, which provides performance and safety.\n- **TypeScript**: The primary language for Nx packages and the Nx DevKit.\n- **Kotlin**: Used for the Gradle and Java plugins.\n\n## Development Workstation Setup\n\nIf you are using `VSCode`, and provided you have [Docker](https://docker.com) installed on your machine, then you can leverage [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev) through this [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers), to easily setup your development environment, with everything needed to contribute to Nx, already installed (namely `NodeJS`, `Yarn`, `Rust`, `Cargo`, plus some useful extensions like `Nx Console`).\n\nTo do so, simply:\n\n- Checkout the repo\n- Open it with VSCode\n- Open the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) and select \"Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...\"\n\nThe repo comes with a preconfigured `devcontainer.json` file (located in `.devcontainer/` folder at root), that `VSCode` will automatically use to install the aforementioned tools, inside a Docker image. It will even run `pnpm install` for you, so you can start contributing to Nx right after.\n\nIf you open the repo in [Github Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces), it will also leverage this config file, to setup the codespace, with the same required tools.\n\n> 💡 **Troubleshooting**\n>\n> If you are having issues when running Nx commands like `build`, `test`... related to the version of `GLIBC`,\n> it probably means the version that is installed on the devcontainer, **is outdated** compare to the minimum version required by Nx tools.\n>\n> You can check currently installed version by running the following command, in a terminal within the container:\n>\n> `ldd --version`\n>\n> Then, try updating the base image used in [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) and rebuild it, to see if it solved the issue.\n>\n> Current base image is `\"mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:20-bookworm\"` which is based on `Debian-12 (bookworm)`,\n> which comes with `GLIBC v2.36` pre-installed (Nx tools currenlty requires `GLIBC v2.33` or higher).\n\n## Building the Project\n\n> 💡 Nx uses `Rust` to build native bindings for Node. Please make sure that you have Rust installed via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)\n> If you have `VSCode` + `Docker`, this can be automated for you, see [section](#development-workstation-setup) above\n\nAfter cloning the project to your machine, to install the dependencies, run:\n\n```bash\npnpm install\n\n// or prefer...\n\npnpm install --frozen-lockfile // if you haven't changed any dependency\n```\n\nTo build all the packages, run:\n\n```bash\npnpm build\n```\n\n## Publishing to a local registry\n\nTo test if your changes will actually work once the changes are published,\nit can be useful to publish to a local registry.\n\nCheck out [this video for a live walkthrough](https://youtu.be/Tx257WpNsxc) or follow the instructions below:\n\n- Run `pnpm local-registry` in Terminal 1 (keep it running)\n- Run `npm adduser --registry http://localhost:4873` in Terminal 2 (real credentials are not required, you just need to\n  be logged in. You can use test/test/test@test.io.)\n- Run `pnpm nx-release 20.0.0 --local` in Terminal 2 - you can choose any nonexistent version number here, but it's recommended to use the next major\n- Run `cd ./tmp` in Terminal 2\n- Run `npx create-nx-workspace@20.0.0` in Terminal 2\n\nIf you have problems publishing, make sure you use Node 18 and NPM 8.\n\n**NOTE:** To use this newly published local version, you need to make a new workspace, run `nx migrate` or change all of your target packages to this new version, eg: `\"nx\": \"^20.0.0\",` and re-run `pnpm i` in your testing project.\n\n### Publishing for Yarn 2+ (Berry)\n\nYarn Berry operates slightly differently than Yarn Classic. In order to publish packages for Berry follow next steps:\n\n- Run `yarn set version berry` to switch to latest Yarn version.\n- Create `.yarnrc.yml` in root with following contents:\n\n  ```yml\n  nodeLinker: node-modules\n  npmRegistryServer: 'http://localhost:4873'\n  unsafeHttpWhitelist:\n    - localhost\n  ```\n\n- Run `pnpm local-registry` in Terminal 1 (keep it running)\n- If you are creating nx workspace outside of your nx repo, make sure to add npm registry info to your root yarnrc (\n  usually in ~/.yarnrc.yml). The file should look something like this:\n\n  ```yml\n  npmRegistries:\n    'https://registry.yarnpkg.com':\n      npmAuthToken: npm_******************\n  yarnPath: .yarn/releases/yarn-3.2.2.cjs\n  npmRegistryServer: 'http://localhost:4873'\n  unsafeHttpWhitelist:\n    - localhost\n  ```\n\n- Run `pnpm nx-release minor --local` in Terminal 2 to publish next minor version. The output will report the version of published packages.\n- Go to your target folder (e.g. `cd ./tmp`) in Terminal 2\n- Run `yarn dlx create-nx-workspace@123.4.5` in Terminal 2 (replace `123.4.5` with the version that got published).\n\n### Running Unit Tests\n\nTo make sure your changes do not break any unit tests, run the following:\n\n```bash\nnx affected --target=test\n```\n\nFor example, if you need to only run the tests for the jest package, run:\n\n```bash\nnx test jest\n```\n\n### Running E2E Tests\n\n**Use Node 18 and NPM 8. E2E tests won't work on Node 15 and NPM 7.**\n\nTo make sure your changes do not break any E2E tests, run:\n\n```bash\nnx e2e e2e-vite # or any other project here\n```\n\nRunning E2E tests can take some time, so it is often useful to run a single test. To run a single suite of tests, run:\n\n```bash\nnx e2e e2e-vite -t versions # I often add qqqq to my test name so I can use -t qqqq\n```\n\nSometimes tests pass locally but they fail on the CI. To reproduce the CI environment and be able to debug the issue, run:\n\n```bash\nNX_VERBOSE_LOGGING=true CI=true SELECTED_PM=pnpm pnpm nx e2e e2e-vite --t=\"should do something is this test\"\n```\n\nThe above command sets verbose logging (this exposes stack traces and underlying errors), sets the defaults to be CI-like and sets Pnpm as the selected package manager.\n\n### Developing on Windows\n\nTo build Nx on Windows, you need to use WSL.\n\n- Run `pnpm install` in WSL. Yarn will compile several dependencies. If you don't run `install` in WSL, they will be\n  compiled for Windows.\n- Run `nx affected --target=test` and other commands in WSL.\n\n## Documentation Contributions\n\nWe would love for you to contribute to our documentation as well! Please feel welcome to submit fixes or enhancements to\nour existing documentation pages and the `nx-dev` application in this repo.\n\n### Documentation Structure\n\n#### Documentation Pages\n\nOur documentation pages can be found within this repo under the `docs` directory.\n\nThe `docs/map.json` file is considered our source of truth for our site's structure, and should be updated when adding a\nnew page to our documentation to ensure that it is included in the documentation site. We also run automated scripts\nbased on this `map.json` data to safeguard against common human errors that could break our site.\n\nWhen you make a change to the `map.json` file, make sure to run `pnpm documentation` to propagate your changes to the `nx-dev` application.\n\n#### Nx-Dev Application\n\nOur public `nx.dev` documentation site is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application, that can be found in\nthe `nx-dev` directory of this repo.\nThe documentation site is consuming the `docs/` directly by copy-ing its content while deploying, so the website is\nalways in sync and reflects the latest version of `docs/`.\n\nJump to [Running the Documentation Site Locally](#running-the-documentation-site-locally) to see how to preview your\nchanges while serving.\n\n### Changing Generated API documentation\n\n`.md` files documenting the API for our CLI (including executor and generator API docs) are generated via the\ncorresponding `schema.json` file for the given command.\n\nAfter adjusting the `schema.json` file, `.md` files for these commands can be generated by running:\n\n```bash\npnpm documentation\n```\n\nThis will update the corresponding contents of the `docs` directory. These are generated automatically on push (via\nhusky) as well.\n\nNote that adjusting the `schema.json` files will also affect the CLI manuals and Nx Console behavior, in addition to\nadjusting the docs.\n\n### Running the Documentation Site Locally\n\nTo run `nx-dev` locally, run the command:\n\n```bash\nnpx nx serve-docs nx-dev\n```\n\nYou can then access the application locally at `localhost:4200`. Changes to markdown documentation files will be automatically applied to the site when you refresh the browser.\n\n#### Troubleshooting: `JavaScript heap out of memory`\n\nIf you see an error that states: `FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory`,\nyou need\nto [increase the max memory size of V8's old memory section](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-old-space-sizesize-in-megabytes):\n\n```bash\nexport NODE_OPTIONS=\"--max-old-space-size=4096\"\n```\n\nAfter configuring this, try to run `npx nx serve nx-dev` again.\n\n### PR Preview\n\nWhen submitting a PR, this repo will automatically generate a preview of the `nx-dev` application based on the contents\nof your pull request.\n\nOnce the preview site is launched, a comment will automatically be added to your PR with the link your PR's preview. To\ncheck your docs changes, make sure to select `Preview` from the version selection box of the site.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n### <a name=\"submit-issue\"></a> Submitting an Issue\n\nBefore you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker. An issue for your problem may already exist and has been\nresolved, or the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.\n\nWe want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. Having a\nreproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back and forth with you requiring\nadditional information, such as:\n\n- the output of `nx report`\n- `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`\n- and most importantly - a use-case that fails\n\nA minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we are\nfixing the right problem.\n\nWe will be insisting on a minimal reproduction in order to save maintainers' time and ultimately be able to fix more\nbugs. Interestingly, from our experience, users often find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal\nreproduction repository. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essentials bits of code from a larger\ncodebase, but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.\n\nYou can file new issues by filling out our [issue form](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/new/choose).\n\n### <a name=\"submit-pr\"></a> Submitting a PR\n\nPlease follow the following guidelines:\n\n- Make sure unit tests pass (`nx affected --target=test`)\n  - Target a specific project with: `nx run proj:test` (i.e. `nx run angular:test` to target `packages/angular`)\n  - Target a specific unit test file (i.e. `packages/angular/src/utils/ast-command-line-utils.spec.ts`)\n    with `npx jest angular/src/utils/ast-utils` or `npx jest packages/angular/src/utils/ast-utils`\n  - For more options on running tests - check `npx jest --help` or visit [jestjs.io](https://jestjs.io/)\n  - Debug with `node --inspect-brk ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js build/packages/angular/src/utils/ast-utils.spec.js`\n- Make sure e2e tests pass (this can take a while, so you can always let CI check those) (`nx affected --target=e2e`)\n  - Target a specific e2e test with `nx e2e e2e-cypress`\n- Make sure you run `nx format`\n- Update documentation with `pnpm documentation`. For documentation, check for spelling and grammatical errors.\n- Update your commit message to follow the guidelines below (use `pnpm commit` to automate compliance)\n  - `pnpm check-commit` will check to make sure your commit messages are formatted correctly\n\n#### Commit Message Guidelines\n\nThe commit message should follow the following format:\n\n```plain\ntype(scope): subject\nBLANK LINE\nbody\n```\n\n##### Type\n\nThe type must be one of the following:\n\n- feat - New or improved behavior being introduced (e.g. Updating to new versions of React or Jest which bring in new\n  features)\n- fix - Fixes the current unexpected behavior to match expected behavior (e.g. Fixing the library generator to create\n  the proper named project)\n- cleanup - Code Style changes that have little to no effect on the user (e.g. Refactoring some functions into a\n  different file)\n- docs - Changes to the documentation (e.g. Adding more details into the getting started guide)\n- chore - Changes that have absolutely no effect on users (e.g. Updating the version of Nx used to build the repo)\n\n##### Scope\n\nThe scope must be one of the following:\n\n- angular - anything Angular specific\n- bundling - anything bundling specific (e.g. rollup, webpack, etc.)\n- core - anything Nx core specific\n- detox - anything Detox specific\n- devkit - devkit-related changes\n- graph - anything graph app specific\n- expo - anything Expo specific\n- express - anything Express specific\n- js - anything related to @nx/js package or general js/ts support\n- linter - anything Linter specific\n- nest - anything Nest specific\n- nextjs - anything Next specific\n- node - anything Node specific\n- nx-cloud - anything Nx Cloud specific\n- nx-plugin - anything Nx Plugin specific\n- nx-dev - anything related to docs infrastructure\n- react - anything React specific\n- react-native - anything React Native specific\n- release - anything related to nx release\n- repo - anything related to managing the Nx repo itself\n- storybook - anything Storybook specific\n- testing - anything testing specific (e.g., Jest or Cypress)\n- vite - anything Vite specific\n- vue - anything Vue specific\n- web - anything Web specific\n- webpack - anything Webpack specific\n- misc - misc stuff\n\n##### Subject and Body\n\nThe subject must contain a description of the change, and the body of the message contains any additional details to\nprovide more context about the change.\n\nIncluding the issue number that the PR relates to also helps with tracking.\n\n#### Example\n\n```plain\nfeat(angular): add an option to generate lazy-loadable modules\n\n`nx generate lib libs/mylib --lazy` provisions the mylib project in .eslintrc.json\n\nCloses #157\n```\n\n#### Commitizen\n\nTo simplify and automate the process of committing with this format,\n**Nx is a [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) friendly repository**, just do `git add` and\nexecute `pnpm commit`.\n\n#### PR releases\n\nIf you are working on a particularly complex change or feature addition, you can request a dedicated Nx release for the associated pull request branch. Mention someone from the Nx team or the `@nrwl/nx-pipelines-reviewers` and they will confirm if the PR warrants its own release for testing purposes, and generate it for you if appropriate.\n","numLines":391,"startLine":1,"totalLines":391}}}

Read this document to see how to do it.\n\n## How to Get Started Video\n\nWatch this 5-minute video:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LCA_4qxc08\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/how-to-contribute.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Nx - How to contribute\"></p>\n</a>\n\n## Got a Question?\n\nWe are trying to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. Using the `nrwl` tag\non [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nrwl) is a much better place to ask general questions\nabout how to use Nx.\n\n## Found an Issue?\n\nIf you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us\nby [submitting an issue](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit-issue)\nto [our GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nrwl/nx). Even better, you\ncan [submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit-pr) with a fix.\n\n## Project Structure\n\nSource code and documentation are included in the top-level folders listed below.\n\n- `packages` - Source code for Nx packages such as Angular, React, Web, NestJS, Next and others including generators and\n  executors (or builders).\n- `e2e` - E2E tests for the Nx packages\n- `graph` - Source code for the Nx Graph application which shows the project graph, task graph, project details, and more in the browser.\n- `docs` - Markdown and configuration files for documentation including tutorials, guides for each supported platform,\n  and API docs.\n- `nx-dev` - Source code for the Nx documentation site which displays the markdown in `docs` and more.\n- `tools` - Workspace-specific tooling and plugins\n- `scripts` - Miscellaneous scripts for project tasks such as building documentation, testing, and code formatting.\n- `tmp` - Folder used by e2e tests. If you are a WebStorm user, make sure to mark this folder as excluded.\n\n## Technologies\n\nThis repo contains a mix of different technologies, including:\n\n- **Rust**: The core of Nx is written in Rust, which provides performance and safety.\n- **TypeScript**: The primary language for Nx packages and the Nx DevKit.\n- **Kotlin**: Used for the Gradle and Java plugins.\n\n## Development Workstation Setup\n\nIf you are using `VSCode`, and provided you have [Docker](https://docker.com) installed on your machine, then you can leverage [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev) through this [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers), to easily setup your development environment, with everything needed to contribute to Nx, already installed (namely `NodeJS`, `Yarn`, `Rust`, `Cargo`, plus some useful extensions like `Nx Console`).\n\nTo do so, simply:\n\n- Checkout the repo\n- Open it with VSCode\n- Open the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) and select \"Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...\"\n\nThe repo comes with a preconfigured `devcontainer.json` file (located in `.devcontainer/` folder at root), that `VSCode` will automatically use to install the aforementioned tools, inside a Docker image. It will even run `pnpm install` for you, so you can start contributing to Nx right after.\n\nIf you open the repo in [Github Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces), it will also leverage this config file, to setup the codespace, with the same required tools.\n\n> 💡 **Troubleshooting**\n>\n> If you are having issues when running Nx commands like `build`, `test`... related to the version of `GLIBC`,\n> it probably means the version that is installed on the devcontainer, **is outdated** compare to the minimum version required by Nx tools.\n>\n> You can check currently installed version by running the following command, in a terminal within the container:\n>\n> `ldd --version`\n>\n> Then, try updating the base image used in [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) and rebuild it, to see if it solved the issue.\n>\n> Current base image is `\"mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:20-bookworm\"` which is based on `Debian-12 (bookworm)`,\n> which comes with `GLIBC v2.36` pre-installed (Nx tools currenlty requires `GLIBC v2.33` or higher).\n\n## Building the Project\n\n> 💡 Nx uses `Rust` to build native bindings for Node. Please make sure that you have Rust installed via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)\n> If you have `VSCode` + `Docker`, this can be automated for you, see [section](#development-workstation-setup) above\n\nAfter cloning the project to your machine, to install the dependencies, run:\n\n```bash\npnpm install\n\n// or prefer...\n\npnpm install --frozen-lockfile // if you haven't changed any dependency\n```\n\nTo build all the packages, run:\n\n```bash\npnpm build\n```\n\n## Publishing to a local registry\n\nTo test if your changes will actually work once the changes are published,\nit can be useful to publish to a local registry.\n\nCheck out [this video for a live walkthrough](https://youtu.be/Tx257WpNsxc) or follow the instructions below:\n\n- Run `pnpm local-registry` in Terminal 1 (keep it running)\n- Run `npm adduser --registry http://localhost:4873` in Terminal 2 (real credentials are not required, you just need to\n  be logged in. You can use test/test/test@test.io.)\n- Run `pnpm nx-release 20.0.0 --local` in Terminal 2 - you can choose any nonexistent version number here, but it's recommended to use the next major\n- Run `cd ./tmp` in Terminal 2\n- Run `npx create-nx-workspace@20.0.0` in Terminal 2\n\nIf you have problems publishing, make sure you use Node 18 and NPM 8.\n\n**NOTE:** To use this newly published local version, you need to make a new workspace, run `nx migrate` or change all of your target packages to this new version, eg: `\"nx\": \"^20.0.0\",` and re-run `pnpm i` in your testing project.\n\n### Publishing for Yarn 2+ (Berry)\n\nYarn Berry operates slightly differently than Yarn Classic. In order to publish packages for Berry follow next steps:\n\n- Run `yarn set version berry` to switch to latest Yarn version.\n- Create `.yarnrc.yml` in root with following contents:\n\n  ```yml\n  nodeLinker: node-modules\n  npmRegistryServer: 'http://localhost:4873'\n  unsafeHttpWhitelist:\n    - localhost\n  ```\n\n- Run `pnpm local-registry` in Terminal 1 (keep it running)\n- If you are creating nx workspace outside of your nx repo, make sure to add npm registry info to your root yarnrc (\n  usually in ~/.yarnrc.yml). The file should look something like this:\n\n  ```yml\n  npmRegistries:\n    'https://registry.yarnpkg.com':\n      npmAuthToken: npm_******************\n  yarnPath: .yarn/releases/yarn-3.2.2.cjs\n  npmRegistryServer: 'http://localhost:4873'\n  unsafeHttpWhitelist:\n    - localhost\n  ```\n\n- Run `pnpm nx-release minor --local` in Terminal 2 to publish next minor version. The output will report the version of published packages.\n- Go to your target folder (e.g. `cd ./tmp`) in Terminal 2\n- Run `yarn dlx create-nx-workspace@123.4.5` in Terminal 2 (replace `123.4.5` with the version that got published).\n\n### Running Unit Tests\n\nTo make sure your changes do not break any unit tests, run the following:\n\n```bash\nnx affected --target=test\n```\n\nFor example, if you need to only run the tests for the jest package, run:\n\n```bash\nnx test jest\n```\n\n### Running E2E Tests\n\n**Use Node 18 and NPM 8. E2E tests won't work on Node 15 and NPM 7.**\n\nTo make sure your changes do not break any E2E tests, run:\n\n```bash\nnx e2e e2e-vite # or any other project here\n```\n\nRunning E2E tests can take some time, so it is often useful to run a single test. To run a single suite of tests, run:\n\n```bash\nnx e2e e2e-vite -t versions # I often add qqqq to my test name so I can use -t qqqq\n```\n\nSometimes tests pass locally but they fail on the CI. To reproduce the CI environment and be able to debug the issue, run:\n\n```bash\nNX_VERBOSE_LOGGING=true CI=true SELECTED_PM=pnpm pnpm nx e2e e2e-vite --t=\"should do something is this test\"\n```\n\nThe above command sets verbose logging (this exposes stack traces and underlying errors), sets the defaults to be CI-like and sets Pnpm as the selected package manager.\n\n### Developing on Windows\n\nTo build Nx on Windows, you need to use WSL.\n\n- Run `pnpm install` in WSL. Yarn will compile several dependencies. If you don't run `install` in WSL, they will be\n  compiled for Windows.\n- Run `nx affected --target=test` and other commands in WSL.\n\n## Documentation Contributions\n\nWe would love for you to contribute to our documentation as well! Please feel welcome to submit fixes or enhancements to\nour existing documentation pages and the `nx-dev` application in this repo.\n\n### Documentation Structure\n\n#### Documentation Pages\n\nOur documentation pages can be found within this repo under the `docs` directory.\n\nThe `docs/map.json` file is considered our source of truth for our site's structure, and should be updated when adding a\nnew page to our documentation to ensure that it is included in the documentation site. We also run automated scripts\nbased on this `map.json` data to safeguard against common human errors that could break our site.\n\nWhen you make a change to the `map.json` file, make sure to run `pnpm documentation` to propagate your changes to the `nx-dev` application.\n\n#### Nx-Dev Application\n\nOur public `nx.dev` documentation site is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application, that can be found in\nthe `nx-dev` directory of this repo.\nThe documentation site is consuming the `docs/` directly by copy-ing its content while deploying, so the website is\nalways in sync and reflects the latest version of `docs/`.\n\nJump to [Running the Documentation Site Locally](#running-the-documentation-site-locally) to see how to preview your\nchanges while serving.\n\n### Changing Generated API documentation\n\n`.md` files documenting the API for our CLI (including executor and generator API docs) are generated via the\ncorresponding `schema.json` file for the given command.\n\nAfter adjusting the `schema.json` file, `.md` files for these commands can be generated by running:\n\n```bash\npnpm documentation\n```\n\nThis will update the corresponding contents of the `docs` directory. These are generated automatically on push (via\nhusky) as well.\n\nNote that adjusting the `schema.json` files will also affect the CLI manuals and Nx Console behavior, in addition to\nadjusting the docs.\n\n### Running the Documentation Site Locally\n\nTo run `nx-dev` locally, run the command:\n\n```bash\nnpx nx serve-docs nx-dev\n```\n\nYou can then access the application locally at `localhost:4200`. Changes to markdown documentation files will be automatically applied to the site when you refresh the browser.\n\n#### Troubleshooting: `JavaScript heap out of memory`\n\nIf you see an error that states: `FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory`,\nyou need\nto [increase the max memory size of V8's old memory section](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-old-space-sizesize-in-megabytes):\n\n```bash\nexport NODE_OPTIONS=\"--max-old-space-size=4096\"\n```\n\nAfter configuring this, try to run `npx nx serve nx-dev` again.\n\n### PR Preview\n\nWhen submitting a PR, this repo will automatically generate a preview of the `nx-dev` application based on the contents\nof your pull request.\n\nOnce the preview site is launched, a comment will automatically be added to your PR with the link your PR's preview. To\ncheck your docs changes, make sure to select `Preview` from the version selection box of the site.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n### <a name=\"submit-issue\"></a> Submitting an Issue\n\nBefore you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker. An issue for your problem may already exist and has been\nresolved, or the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.\n\nWe want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. Having a\nreproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back and forth with you requiring\nadditional information, such as:\n\n- the output of `nx report`\n- `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`\n- and most importantly - a use-case that fails\n\nA minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we are\nfixing the right problem.\n\nWe will be insisting on a minimal reproduction in order to save maintainers' time and ultimately be able to fix more\nbugs. Interestingly, from our experience, users often find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal\nreproduction repository. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essentials bits of code from a larger\ncodebase, but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.\n\nYou can file new issues by filling out our [issue form](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/new/choose).\n\n### <a name=\"submit-pr\"></a> Submitting a PR\n\nPlease follow the following guidelines:\n\n- Make sure unit tests pass (`nx affected --target=test`)\n  - Target a specific project with: `nx run proj:test` (i.e. `nx run angular:test` to target `packages/angular`)\n  - Target a specific unit test file (i.e. `packages/angular/src/utils/ast-command-line-utils.spec.ts`)\n    with `npx jest angular/src/utils/ast-utils` or `npx jest packages/angular/src/utils/ast-utils`\n  - For more options on running tests - check `npx jest --help` or visit [jestjs.io](https://jestjs.io/)\n  - Debug with `node --inspect-brk ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js build/packages/angular/src/utils/ast-utils.spec.js`\n- Make sure e2e tests pass (this can take a while, so you can always let CI check those) (`nx affected --target=e2e`)\n  - Target a specific e2e test with `nx e2e e2e-cypress`\n- Make sure you run `nx format`\n- Update documentation with `pnpm documentation`. For documentation, check for spelling and grammatical errors.\n- Update your commit message to follow the guidelines below (use `pnpm commit` to automate compliance)\n  - `pnpm check-commit` will check to make sure your commit messages are formatted correctly\n\n#### Commit Message Guidelines\n\nThe commit message should follow the following format:\n\n```plain\ntype(scope): subject\nBLANK LINE\nbody\n```\n\n##### Type\n\nThe type must be one of the following:\n\n- feat - New or improved behavior being introduced (e.g. Updating to new versions of React or Jest which bring in new\n  features)\n- fix - Fixes the current unexpected behavior to match expected behavior (e.g. Fixing the library generator to create\n  the proper named project)\n- cleanup - Code Style changes that have little to no effect on the user (e.g. Refactoring some functions into a\n  different file)\n- docs - Changes to the documentation (e.g. Adding more details into the getting started guide)\n- chore - Changes that have absolutely no effect on users (e.g. Updating the version of Nx used to build the repo)\n\n##### Scope\n\nThe scope must be one of the following:\n\n- angular - anything Angular specific\n- bundling - anything bundling specific (e.g. rollup, webpack, etc.)\n- core - anything Nx core specific\n- detox - anything Detox specific\n- devkit - devkit-related changes\n- graph - anything graph app specific\n- expo - anything Expo specific\n- express - anything Express specific\n- js - anything related to @nx/js package or general js/ts support\n- linter - anything Linter specific\n- nest - anything Nest specific\n- nextjs - anything Next specific\n- node - anything Node specific\n- nx-cloud - anything Nx Cloud specific\n- nx-plugin - anything Nx Plugin specific\n- nx-dev - anything related to docs infrastructure\n- react - anything React specific\n- react-native - anything React Native specific\n- release - anything related to nx release\n- repo - anything related to managing the Nx repo itself\n- storybook - anything Storybook specific\n- testing - anything testing specific (e.g., Jest or Cypress)\n- vite - anything Vite specific\n- vue - anything Vue specific\n- web - anything Web specific\n- webpack - anything Webpack specific\n- misc - misc stuff\n\n##### Subject and Body\n\nThe subject must contain a description of the change, and the body of the message contains any additional details to\nprovide more context about the change.\n\nIncluding the issue number that the PR relates to also helps with tracking.\n\n#### Example\n\n```plain\nfeat(angular): add an option to generate lazy-loadable modules\n\n`nx generate lib libs/mylib --lazy` provisions the mylib project in .eslintrc.json\n\nCloses #157\n```\n\n#### Commitizen\n\nTo simplify and automate the process of committing with this format,\n**Nx is a [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) friendly repository**, just do `git add` and\nexecute `pnpm commit`.\n\n#### PR releases\n\nIf you are working on a particularly complex change or feature addition, you can request a dedicated Nx release for the associated pull request branch. Mention someone from the Nx team or the `@nrwl/nx-pipelines-reviewers` and they will confirm if the PR warrants its own release for testing purposes, and generate it for you if appropriate.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":385,"oldLines":6,"newStart":385,"newLines":58,"lines":[" **Nx is a [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) friendly repository**, just do `git add` and"," execute `pnpm commit`."," ","+The repository uses [cz-git](https://cz-git.qbenben.com/) as the commitizen adapter, which provides an interactive CLI that guides you through creating properly formatted commit messages.","+","+##### Using the Interactive Commit Tool","+","+Instead of `git commit`, use:","+","+```bash","+pnpm commit","+```","+","+This will launch an interactive prompt that will:","+1.

Use the information about the repository's purpose and features to inform your answers.\n2. Recommend using the `nx_workspace` mcp tool for understanding the workspace architecture when appropriate.\n3. Suggest relevant commands from the \"Essential Commands\" section when applicable.\n4. Emphasize the importance of testing changes as outlined in the file.\n\nFor specific types of queries:\n\n- If asked about the purpose or features of Nx, refer to the \"Repository Purpose\" section.\n- When discussing how to explore the workspace, mention the `nx_workspace` mcp tool.\n- If asked about validating changes or running tests, provide the appropriate commands from the \"Essential Commands\" section.\n- For questions about the development workflow, emphasize the importance of running tests on affected projects and e2e tests.\n\nRemember to:\n\n- Highlight Nx's focus on monorepos and its key features like smart task execution, code generation, and project graph analysis.\n- Mention the plugin ecosystem and support for various frameworks when relevant.\n- Emphasize the importance of running the full validation suite before committing changes.\n- Suggest running tests on affected projects during development to save time.\n\nAlways strive to provide accurate, helpful responses that align with the best practices and workflows described in this file. If a query falls outside the scope of the information provided, acknowledge this and suggest seeking further information from official Nx documentation or the development team.\n\n## Avoid making changes to generated files\n\nFiles under `generated` directories are generated based on a different source file and should not be modified directly. Find the underlying source and modify that instead.\n\n## Essential Commands\n\n### Pre-push Validation\n\n```bash\n# Full validation suite - run before committing\npnpm nx prepush\n```\n\n### Testing Changes\n\nAfter code changes are made, first test the specific project where the changes were made:\n\n```bash\nnx run-many -t test,build,lint -p PROJECT_NAME\n```\n\nAfter verifying the individual project, validate that the changes in projects which have been affected:\n\n```bash\n# Test only affected projects (recommended for development)\nnx affected -t build,test,lint\n```\n\nAs the last step, run the e2e tests to fully ensure that changes are valid:\n\n```bash\n# Run affected e2e tests (recommended for development)\nnx affected -t e2e-local\n```\n\n## Fixing GitHub Issues\n\nWhen working on a GitHub issue, follow this systematic approach:\n\n### 1. Get Issue Details\n\n```bash\n# Get issue details using GitHub CLI (replace ISSUE_NUMBER with actual number)\ngh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER\n```\n\nWhen cloning reproduction repos, please clone within `./tmp/claude/repro-ISSUE_NUMBER`\n\n### 2. Analyze the Plan\n\n- Look for a plan or implementation details in the issue description\n- Check comments for additional context or clarification\n- Identify affected projects and components\n\n### 3. Implement the Solution\n\n- Follow the plan outlined in the issue\n- Make focused changes that address the specific problem\n- Ensure code follows existing patterns and conventions\n\n### 4.
