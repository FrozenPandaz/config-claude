First-party code contained in the workspace is added to the project graph automatically. Whether your project contains TypeScript or say Java, both projects will be created in the same way. However, Nx does not know how to analyze Java sources, and that's what plugins can do.\n\nThe shape of the [`createDependencies`](/reference/core-api/devkit/documents/CreateDependencies) function follows:\n\n```typescript\nexport type CreateDependencies<T> = (\n  opts: T,\n  context: CreateDependenciesContext\n) => CandidateDependency[] | Promise<CandidateDependency[]>;\n```\n\nIn the `createDependencies` function, you can analyze the files in the workspace and return a list of dependencies. It's up to the plugin to determine how to analyze the files. This should also be exported from the plugin's entry point, as listed in `nx.json`.\n\nWithin the `CreateDependenciesContext`, you have access to the graph's external nodes, the configuration of each project in the workspace, the `nx.json` configuration from the workspace, all files in the workspace, and files that have changed since the last invocation. It's important to utilize the `filesToProcess` parameter, as this will allow Nx to only reanalyze files that have changed since the last invocation, and reuse the information from the previous invocation for files that haven't changed.\n\n`@nx/devkit` exports a function called `validateDependency` which can be used to validate a dependency. This function takes in a `CandidateDependency` and the `CreateDependenciesContext` and throws an error if the dependency is invalid. This function is called when the returned dependencies are merged with the existing project graph, but may be useful to call within your plugin to validate dependencies before returning them when debugging.\n\nThe dependencies can be of three types:\n\n*   Implicit\n*   Static\n*   Dynamic\n<br/>- Example <br/> ### Example\n\n{% callout type=\"note\" title=\"More details\" %}\nEven though the plugin is written in JavaScript, resolving dependencies of different languages will probably be more easily written in their native language. Therefore, a common approach is to spawn a new process and communicate via IPC or `stdout`.\n{% /callout %}\n\nA small plugin that recognizes dependencies to projects in the current workspace which a referenced in another project's `package.json` file may look like so:\n\n```typescript {% fileName=\"/my-plugin/index.ts\" %}\nexport const createDependencies: CreateDependencies = (opts, ctx) => {\n  const packageJsonProjectMap = new Map();\n  const nxProjects = Object.values(ctx.projectsConfigurations);\n  const results = [];\n  for (const project of nxProjects) {\n    const maybePackageJsonPath = join(project.root, 'package.json');\n    if (existsSync(maybePackageJsonPath)) {\n      const json = JSON.parse(maybePackageJsonPath);\n      packageJsonProjectMap.set(json.name, project.name);\n    }\n  }\n  for (const project of nxProjects) {\n    const maybePackageJsonPath = join(project.root, 'package.json');\n    if (existsSync(maybePackageJsonPath)) {\n      const json = JSON.parse(maybePackageJsonPath);\n      const deps = [...Object.keys(json.dependencies)];\n      for (const dep of deps) {\n        if (packageJsonProjectMap.has(dep)) {\n          const newDependency = {\n            source: project,\n            target: packageJsonProjectMap.get(dep),\n            sourceFile: maybePackageJsonPath,\n            dependencyType: DependencyType.static,\n          };\n        }\n        validateDependency(newDependency, ctx);\n        results.push(newDependency);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return results;\n};\n```\n\nBreaking down this example, we can see that it follows this flow:\n\n1.  Initializes an array to hold dependencies it locates\n2.  Builds a map of all projects in the workspace, mapping the name inside their package.json to their Nx project name.\n3.  Looks at the package.json files within the workspace and:\n4.  Checks if the dependency is another project\n5.  Builds a dependency from this information\n6.  Validates the dependency\n7.  Pushes it into the located dependency array\n8.  Returns the located dependencies\n<br/>- Single Version Policy <br/> ## Single Version Policy\n\nWith this strategy, developers define all dependencies in the root `package.json` file. This enforces a single version for all dependencies across the codebase, which avoids the problems listed above. Individual projects may still have `package.json` files, but they are used only for the metadata defined there, not as a way of defining the dependencies of that project.\n\nIf there are React and Angular apps in the same repo, we don't want both frameworks bundled in the build artifacts of the individual apps. That's why the plugins Nx provides come with executors that use Nx's graph of dependencies to automatically populate the `dependencies` section of the individual `package.json` files in the build output and pre-populate a lock file for you. This enables your build artifacts to only contain the dependencies that are actually used by that app. As soon as a developer removes the last usage of a particular dependency, that dependency will be removed from the bundle.\n\nThe primary concern people have with this approach is that of coordinating updates. If two different teams are working on React apps in the same repo, they'll need to agree about when to upgrade React across the repo. This is a valid concern and beyond the scope of Nx to solve. If the developers can't cooperate, they should probably work in separate repos. On the other hand, if the teams can agree, it becomes much less work to upgrade the whole repo at the same time rather than performing that same upgrade process multiple times spread out over months or years. Performing the same code manipulation 100 places all at once is much easier than remembering how to perform that code manipulation 100 different times spread out over a year.\n\nConsult the Nx executor's reference page to find options for populating dependencies and a lock file. If you would like to use Nx's graph to populate the dependencies of a project in your own scripts or custom executor, read about how to [prepare applications for deployment via CI](/ci/recipes/other/ci-deployment).\n<br/>- Extras - Dependencies <br/> ## Extras - Dependencies\n\nIn this example, you can still use the implicit dependencies to manually tell Nx which projects your new libraries depend on.\n"}]}]},"uuid":"b72aa6a9-2060-4f96-a862-cac0f96c8538","timestamp":"2025-06-10T23:46:04.009Z","toolUseResult":[{"type":"text","text":"Below are some documentation sections that could be relevant to the user request.
