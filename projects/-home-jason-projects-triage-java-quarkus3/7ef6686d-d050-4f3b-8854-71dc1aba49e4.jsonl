Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Environment Variables in AI Assistant Systems\n\nEnvironment variables are used to change program settings in AI assistant applications, and you need to redeploy if there are changes.\n\n### Common AI Assistant Environment Variables\n\n**OpenAI API Integration:**\nTo use the OpenAI API, you should set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable, specify it via apiKey field in the configuration file, or pass the API key as an argument to the constructor.(no content)OpenAI recommends setting the variable name to OPENAI_API_KEY to keep this variable name consistent across your team, allowing you to commit and share code without risking API key exposure.\n\n**AI SDK Environment Variables:**\nThe AI SDK's OpenAI Provider will default to using the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.\n\n### Bot and Assistant Platforms\n\n**Kore.ai Platform:**\nEnvironment Variables are global, reusable components which can be used in multiple places to define bot configuration. Every Environment Variable is a key-value pair, and the Variable Keys can be used at various places in the bot configuration.(no content)During virtual assistant definition, developers may create environment variables for sensitive data like credentials/keys. These variables are useful for connecting to other systems using service nodes or as part of authorization profiles.\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nAPI keys are saved in environment variables so they don't get saved in source code. The benefit is that you will not accidentally share your secret key with the world if you put your code on GitHub.(no content)The Kore.ai XO Platform introduces the Secure Variable feature for environment variables, which encrypts the added variable when enabled. During export of a secure variable, it has an empty value, so the original value is not available in plain text.\n\n### AI Tools Usage Context\n\nThe search results show various AI assistant tools being used across different domains:\n\nThere are 15 best AI coding assistant tools in 2025 for boosting productivity and code quality, with Qodo being noted as the best AI code assistant with powerful test case generation capabilities and intelligent code suggestions.(no content)AI personal assistants are like digital sidekicks that take on everyday tasks â€” drafting emails, scheduling meetings, and generating reports â€” so you can focus on high-value, strategic work.\n\nThe search didn't return specific results about an \"AI_ASSISTANT\" environment variable as a standard or widely-used variable name, but it did reveal the common patterns and practices for using environment variables in AI assistant systems, particularly for API key management and configuration settings."}]},"uuid":"b7c21966-8378-463f-9757-d1e298731b8c","timestamp":"2025-06-17T18:02:20.726Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"AI_ASSISTANT environment variable AI tools usage","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01KCGe6x94dY1JjnYTTETXoR","content":[{"title":"15 Best AI Coding Assistant Tools in 2025 - Qodo","url":"https://www.qodo.ai/blog/best-ai-coding-assistant-tools/"},{"title":"Dify x DeepSeek: Deploy a Private AI Assistant & Build a Local DeepSeek R1 + Web Search App - Dify Blog","url":"https://dify.ai/blog/dify-deepseek-deploy-a-private-ai-assistant"},{"title":"How To Use an AI Personal Assistant for Work: Top 8 Tools | Otter.ai","url":"https://otter.ai/blog/ai-personal-assistant-for-work"},{"title":"Canva AI: Your all-in-one AI assistant","url":"https://www.canva.com/ai-assistant/"},{"title":"How to Build AI Agents Using Plan-and-Execute Loops","url":"https://www.willowtreeapps.com/craft/building-ai-agents-with-plan-and-execute"},{"title":"Getting started | AI Assistant Documentation","url":"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ai-assistant/getting-started-with-ai-assistant.html"},{"title":"Agents in AI - GeeksforGeeks","url":"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/agents-artificial-intelligence/"},{"title":"Warp: Agent Mode in Warp AI","url":"https://www.warp.dev/warp-ai"},{"title":"How to Make Your Own AI Assistant (Use Cases & Tools)","url":"https://clickup.com/blog/how-to-make-your-own-ai-assistant/"},{"title":"Which AI coding assistant should I be using? | Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science","url":"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/05/19/which-ai-coding-assistant-should-i-be-using/"}]},"Based on the search results, I found some information about AI assistant tools and their usage, but the specific search query \"AI_ASSISTANT environment variable AI tools usage\" didn't return targeted results about environment variables.
