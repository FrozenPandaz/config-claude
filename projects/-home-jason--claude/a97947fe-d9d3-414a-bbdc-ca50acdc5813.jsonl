This will generate migrations.json: ... Update @nx/workspace and generate the list of migrations starting with version 8.0.0 of @nx/workspace and @nx/node, regardless of what is installed locally\n\n**Interactive mode:**\nCollect package updates and migrations in interactive mode. In this mode, the user will be prompted whether to apply any optional package update and migration\n\n## Important Notes for Migration\n\n### @nrwl to @nx Scope Change\nThere was a significant change from the `@nrwl` scope to `@nx` scope around version 16.
