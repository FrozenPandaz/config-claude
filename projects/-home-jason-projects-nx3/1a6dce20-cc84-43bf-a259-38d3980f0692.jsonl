Even if the functionality is failing, it should only be high priority if it affects many people.\\n- Medium: Standard bugs, feature improvements, configuration issues\\n- Low: Documentation improvements, minor UX issues\\n\\n**Output Format:**\\nReport the analysis with:\\n1. Issues grouped by assignee\\n2. Include issue number, title, priority level, and recommended scope label\\n3. Brief explanation of why each issue fits that team member's expertise and scope\\n4. Summary statistics (priority distribution, scope distribution, workload balance)\\n```\\n\\n## Make these updates to the github issues \\n\\n1. Add a labels for scope: and priority: and assign the tasks in bulk using the `--add-assignee` flag.\\n\\n2. Apply the assignees in bulk, then apply the scope: in bulk, and then apply the priority label in bulk.\\n\\n## Showing Results\\n\\nShow results in a compact format where each issue is only given a single line.\\n\\nOpen all the issues by opening them in the browser one by one with the following command:\\n```bash\\nfor issue in [List of issues]; do open\\n      https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/$issue; done)\\n```\\n\\n## Customization Options\\n\\nYou can modify the command by:\\n- Changing the number of issues to analyze (default: 25)\\n- Adjusting priority criteria\\n- Adding/removing team members\\n- Changing the date range for issue fetching\\n\\n## Example Variations\\n\\n**For Specific Time Period:**\\n```\\nAnalyze unassigned GitHub issues from the last 7 days and assign them...\\n```\\n\\n**For Specific Labels:**\\n```\\nAnalyze unassigned GitHub issues with labels \\\"bug\\\" or \\\"type: feature\\\" from the last 30 days and assign them...\\n```\\n\\n**For Workload Balancing:**\\n```\\nAnalyze the last 25 unassigned GitHub issues, assign them to team members, and highlight any workload imbalances.
