# Commit Messages
Keep commit messages concise and descriptive. Use conventional commit format when possible (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)

The main github repo that I work on is nrwl/nx so please use that repo when you need to find stuff out from github

# Tmux Usage
IMPORTANT: Every Claude session should have its own dedicated tmux pane.
- At the start of a session, create a new tmux pane for this session's work
- Run all commands (both quick and long-running) in this dedicated pane
- Keep the pane organized and monitor output as needed
- Use this pane for dev servers, watchers, builds, and any other commands
